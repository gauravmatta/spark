2
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:24,508
Hey, kiddo.

3
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,677
- What?
- I found something.

4
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:28,915
You gotta check this out.

5
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:32,017
"Jumanji."

6
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:35,219
Board game?

7
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,758
Who plays board games?

8
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:13,650
Parry. Parry.

9
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,852
Evade. Blam.

10
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:17,589
Uppercut.

11
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,823
Head slam. You're dead.

12
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:21,627
Strike. Strike.
Counterstrike. Head slam.

13
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:22,960
Ka-pow.

14
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:26,096
Get ready. Fight.

15
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:28,765
I got it.

16
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:39,845
"...Benjamin Franklin,

17
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,347
"and it was this sense
of national exceptionalism

18
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,184
that fueled the spreading
wildfire of westward expansion."

19
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:47,720
Spencer? Honey?

20
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:51,156
Aah! Mom, what did we say
about the knocking?

21
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:54,092
I'm late for work. You going
to your father's after school?

22
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:56,095
- Yeah, probably.
- Don't forget your EpiPen.

23
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:58,229
Please, remember,
the world is terrifying.

24
00:03:58,231 --> 00:03:59,698
Be careful of everything.

25
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,065
I love you
more than life itself. Bye.

26
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,366
- See you Sunday night.
- Okay.

27
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:11,676
- Later, Mama.
- Eat something.

28
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:13,077
I can't.
I gotta go meet Spencer.

29
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,847
- Spencer Gilpin?
- Yeah, Spencer Gilpin.

30
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:17,249
He's, uh...
He's been tutoring me.

31
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:19,918
- He's helping get my grades up.
- I love to hear that.

32
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,153
- Little Spencer Gilpin.
- Yeah.

33
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:24,990
- Your grades gonna be okay?
- That's why I'm getting help.

34
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:27,392
I'd hate for you
to get dropped from the team...

35
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:29,663
I'm not gonna get dropped
from the team.

36
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:33,768
It's... It's gonna
be fine. Okay?

37
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:43,712
Mm.

38
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:54,752
Okay.

39
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,956
That's cute, right?

40
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,795
Yeah.

41
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:23,652
- Yo.
- Hey, Fridge.

42
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,753
Why you wearing a raincoat?

43
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:29,054
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's not raining.

44
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:30,822
Oh, well, it might.

45
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:32,990
I mean, you never know
what's gonna happen.

46
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:36,895
- Oy vey.
- What the hell, man?

47
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:38,497
Do you mind?
Can we speed this up?

48
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:41,066
Freak House makes me
very uncomfortable.

49
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,039
Here you go.

50
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:46,772
- You proofread everything?
- Yeah, I proofed it.

51
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:49,876
And I gave it a beginning...

52
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:52,212
and an ending
and s-some in the middle.

53
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:55,080
I would've done it myself,
if I had the time or whatever,

54
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:57,217
- but...
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

55
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:00,253
Hey, man, I was thinking, so...
I mean, it's been really fun,

56
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:02,789
doing your papers
and your homework and stuff,

57
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,024
but I don't know
what you're doing this weekend.

58
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:07,926
- I was thinking maybe we could...
- This weekend. Yeah, ah...

59
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:10,896
- Hey, Fridge.
- Hey.

60
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:13,198
You need a ride?

61
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,300
- I'm going with her.
- You know what?

62
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:19,304
That's actually better for me,
scheduling-wise, too, so...

63
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,109
See you later, Refrigerator.

64
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:24,176
Sorry. Sorry.

65
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:26,248
What up, girl?

66
00:06:27,782 --> 00:06:29,849
Whatever.

67
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:31,784
It's not like
I was your best friend

68
00:06:31,786 --> 00:06:32,986
for your entire childhood.

69
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:34,553
- That's fine.
- What'd you say?

70
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:39,994
Uh, nothing, sir.

71
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:43,429
Oh, that guy is super weird.

72
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:45,231
That poor man.

73
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,970
So awful what happened
to those people.

74
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:50,837
I was talking about the kid.

75
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,105
What are you doing out here?

76
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,976
I was just talking to my friend.

77
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:56,442
You should be more careful

78
00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:57,943
where you loiter, you hear me?

79
00:06:57,945 --> 00:06:59,945
Yes, Mr. Vreeke. I hear you.

80
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:02,886
This world swallows up
kids like you.

81
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:23,036
It's been over two
hours since I've posted,

82
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,171
and he hasn't commented.
He hasn't even liked it.

83
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:27,340
- You saw it.
- Yeah, gorge.

84
00:07:27,342 --> 00:07:29,175
I don't know
what his problem is.

85
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:31,312
Thank you. It's not like
I post all the time,

86
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:32,912
just enough to stay relevant.

87
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:34,348
But it's cute enough
for Noah to...

88
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,386
Hey, there's
some rando behind you.

89
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:40,119
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:43,057
Bethany, did you just make
a call during a quiz?

91
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,591
Yeah. But I finished
my quiz already.

92
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:48,864
Oh, okay. Well, have you noticed
that other people haven't?

93
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:53,033
- So?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Let me back up.

94
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:56,369
You're aware there are other
people in the world, right?

95
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,607
Look, um, you know,

96
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:02,174
I'm dealing with something
right now,

97
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:04,177
and I'm no happier
about it than you are.

98
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,946
I'm having a crisis,
and Lucinda, I mean,

99
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:08,615
she's supporting me as a woman,

100
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:10,953
and it feels like
maybe you should too.

101
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,487
- Just hang up the phone.
- Okay, I'll wrap it up.

102
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:17,490
- Bethany, hang it up now.
- Two minutes and we're done.

103
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,360
And that's detention.

104
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:23,299
All right, keep
those arms pumping.

105
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:24,898
Let's go!

106
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,266
Bethany, you're late.

107
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:27,403
Sorry.

108
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:32,239
I heard she broke up
with that football guy.

109
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,208
This could be
your opening, Fussfeld.

110
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,377
We're gonna practice

111
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,646
catching and throwing.

112
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:42,152
So partner up and grab
a football. Let's move!

113
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:45,653
Hey, Martha.

114
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:49,223
Martha. You can't
play catch by yourself.

115
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:50,926
Pair up.

116
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:52,492
Come on. Let's go.

117
00:08:52,494 --> 00:08:54,365
No. No, I'm good.

118
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:56,430
Okay.

119
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:03,104
You have to participate
just like everybody else.

120
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:05,405
Otherwise,
why are you even here?

121
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:06,640
It's a requirement.

122
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,276
- Martha...
- I think it's pointless.

123
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:10,344
Gym class is not gonna get me
into Princeton,

124
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:12,478
and I don't understand
the obsession with throwing

125
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,115
a ball into a hoop
and, "Touchdown, five points!"

126
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:18,219
Okay. There's a lot wrong
with that, but first of all...

127
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:20,387
It's physical activity,
which is good for you.

128
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:22,589
With other people,
also good for you.

129
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:26,226
And if you try it,
you might even have some fun.

130
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,695
Fun. That's what
we're doing here? Fun?

131
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:30,397
This is school.

132
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,033
We are supposed to be
learning things that matter.

133
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:34,335
- Okay, Martha...
- We don't have

134
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:36,437
a lot of time in this life,
and I personally

135
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:39,943
don't wanna waste it on being,
like, a gym teacher.

136
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:45,146
- That... That came out wrong.
- Yeah, it sure did.

137
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:46,983
That's detention.

138
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,719
That was hard-core.

139
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:52,619
Badass.

140
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:55,425
Spencer Gilpin?

141
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:00,131
Have a seat, Spencer.

142
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:12,206
Miss Mathers?

143
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,709
"And it was this sense
of national exceptionalism

144
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:18,747
that fueled the spreading
wildfire of westward expansion."

145
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:21,485
Does that sound familiar,
Mr. Gilpin?

146
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:26,022
- It does not.
- It's the last sentence

147
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:28,224
of Anthony's paper
on westward expansion.

148
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,691
And, coincidentally,
it's the last sentence

149
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:34,064
of your paper on westward
expansion from last year.

150
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,632
That's interesting.

151
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:40,402
Is it?

152
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:43,671
I think so. I mean,
what are the odds of that?

153
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:45,305
Slim.

154
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:48,243
Yeah, you also
used the same metaphor:

155
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:50,378
"the spreading wildfire,"
in your papers

156
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,115
on the Boston Tea Party,
the Battle of Gettysburg,

157
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:56,420
and the women's suffrage
movement.

158
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,488
It's so hot in this room.

159
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,260
Anthony, I know how much
you need to pass my class,

160
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:06,661
but this is not how you do it.

161
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:09,398
- I will not tolerate cheating.
- Cheating?

162
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,566
I didn't... I didn't...
I didn't cheat.

163
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:13,004
It was my fault.

164
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,138
I made him do it.

165
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,346
You made him...
have you write his paper?

166
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:24,278
Yeah.

167
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,815
Mm-hm.

168
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:31,287
Look.
I'm sorry, okay?

169
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,422
No, no, it's not okay.

170
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:36,156
What the hell, man?
You got me kicked off the team.

171
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:38,258
Yeah, well, you could've
gotten me expelled.

172
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,162
It's not like you're the only
one who's living dangerously.

173
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:42,629
- Living dangerously?
- Yes.

174
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:46,368
This is the most dangerous thing
I've ever done in my life.

175
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,471
And now look at me.
I'm paying the price.

176
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:52,173
Well...

177
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:54,243
isn't this a fun group?

178
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:57,182
Welcome to detention.

179
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:58,781
Yes, Spencer?

180
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:00,416
I wanna say that I'm sorry.

181
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,784
- Thank you.
- Bentley, all I did was make...

182
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:05,321
Bethany, please.
You're all here for a reason.

183
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:06,622
You know what it is.

184
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,858
But this is what
you should be thinking about:

185
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,893
Who you are...

186
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:13,662
in this moment in time,

187
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,599
and who you want to be.

188
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,901
You get one life.

189
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,269
You decide
how you're gonna spend it.

190
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,773
Fortunately...

191
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:27,810
there is no better place
for self-reflection

192
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,279
than detention.

193
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,116
Get up, everybody. Let's go.

194
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:46,795
We are turning this
into a new computer center.

195
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:49,431
But before we do,
it has to be cleaned out.

196
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:52,234
These old magazines are bound
for the recycling plant.

197
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:54,836
But they have to be prepped
before they go.

198
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:58,674
It seems all the staples
must be removed.

199
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:01,577
Whatever you don't finish today,
you finish tomorrow.

200
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,712
- Tomorrow's Saturday.
- Because I wouldn't play?

201
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,681
- I don't think that'll work.
- That's fair.

202
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:09,784
- Shut up.
- So I suggest you get started.

203
00:13:09,786 --> 00:13:12,323
Choose your weapons.

204
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:20,563
Hey, what the hell
they need with a bowling ball?

205
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,667
Seriously, no reception?

206
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,302
- Okay, can today get any worse?
- Are you gonna help?

207
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,772
Or are you too pretty?

208
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,672
I'm too pretty.

209
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,514
Hey. I was watching you
with Coach Web today.

210
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:40,382
I wasn't watching you,
I wasn't...

211
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,985
Not, like, in a weird way.
I just...

212
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,919
I was in the room.
We're in the same class.

213
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:46,990
Um, but I thought you were
saying some really smart things

214
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,293
about why P.E. sucks and, um...

215
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,461
about other subjects.

216
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,599
Thanks.

217
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,235
Yeah.

218
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:03,639
Yo. What's this?

219
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,309
- I don't know.
- What is it, like,

220
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,646
some type of old-school
Nintendo or something?

221
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,380
I don't think so.

222
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:13,451
I don't recognize it.

223
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:33,803
"A game for those
who seek to find...

224
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:36,674
"a way to leave
their world behind.

225
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:40,809
Jumanji."

226
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,412
Staples, people. Staples.

227
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,746
"Jumanji"?
What does that mean?

228
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,782
I have no idea.
Never heard of it.

229
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,352
Hm...

230
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:51,856
Uh, which one do I pick?

231
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,490
I don't know. I don't
think it matters that much.

232
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:57,294
"Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough.

233
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,563
Pilot and rascal."

234
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,533
- It's not working.
- Okay, try another one.

235
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,303
"Franklin 'Moose' Finbar."

236
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,769
Hm.

237
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:08,039
He sounds like a badass.

238
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,478
And he's a zoology expert,
which is awesome.

239
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,248
- You pick.
- Okay.

240
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,752
"Dr. Smolder Bravestone."

241
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,689
Bethany, you in?

242
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,292
Fine.

243
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,660
I'll be...

244
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:33,797
Shelly Oberon...

245
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,098
the curvy genius.

246
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:38,935
Hey, yo, Staples, come on.
It's your turn.

247
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,438
Uh, no.

248
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,939
- No, thanks.
- Wait. Just for a few minutes?

249
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,942
It'll be fun.

250
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,346
She's not big on fun.

251
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:52,418
Okay. Fine.

252
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,555
This may be the
lamest thing I've ever done.

253
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,358
I highly doubt that.

254
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,701
Welcome to Jumanji!

255
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,511
What's going on?

256
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,451
I think it's shorting out.

257
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,394
Unplug it!

258
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,734
Whoa!

259
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,668
What's going on?
What's happening to your hands?

260
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,940
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

261
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:51,745
Spencer!

262
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,179
Oh, my God!

263
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,750
Oh-oh-oh...

264
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:02,153
Aah!

265
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:05,023
What the hell, man?

266
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,524
Oh, no.

267
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:10,398
Holy shit...

268
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,036
Whoa!

269
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,643
Aah.

270
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,863
Guys?

271
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:49,569
Guys? Why do I
sound like this?

272
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,445
Where's my hair?

273
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,822
What the...?

274
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,627
Oh, God!

275
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:16,527
Ow, unh.

276
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,579
Huh?

277
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,145
Oh...

278
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,752
What kind of stupid-ass...?

279
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,988
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

280
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,624
Who is she?

281
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,760
Who are you guys? Huh?

282
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,729
Okay, what the hell?

283
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,564
God! Oh, my God!

284
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,999
- Get off of me!
- I am suing...

285
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:56,668
- What's wrong with my voice?
- Get off of me!

286
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,073
- Where am I?
- You're crushing me! Get off!

287
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:01,777
Get...

288
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:10,749
What the hell?
What happened to the rest of me?

289
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:13,286
What is this?
What is this on my back?

290
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,286
What is this?

291
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:16,756
Oh, my God.

292
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:17,726
Fridge?

293
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,062
Yeah, I'm Fridge.
Who are you?

294
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,598
I'm Spencer.

295
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,170
What? The hell you are.
What is going on? Huh?

296
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:32,971
I think...

297
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:34,172
we're in the game.

298
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,608
- Sorry, excuse me?
- What are you talking about?

299
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,210
Somehow, I don't know how...

300
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:41,613
I think we got, like,
sucked into the game.

301
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,783
And we've become the avatars
that we chose.

302
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:47,319
So it's me, Spencer,
but yet I look and sound...

303
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:51,526
like Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

304
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:58,898
You're telling me
that you're Spencer?

305
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,800
Yes, yes, yes. That's it.

306
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:04,670
Fridge, I'm Spencer.
Which means you're Moose Finbar.

307
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:07,009
It says it right there
on your vest. And...

308
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,741
- Martha?
- Yeah.

309
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,943
You're Ruby Roundhouse.

310
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:15,748
And, Bethany,
you're Professor Shelly Oberon.

311
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,682
Only Shelly must be
short for Sheldon.

312
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:18,950
What are you talking about?

313
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,987
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's right.

314
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:23,255
And you...

315
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:25,324
you're Spencer? You?

316
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:26,859
Yes. Guys, I'm telling you.

317
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:29,229
I am Spencer. I'm... Aah!

318
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:30,729
Yep, that's Spencer.

319
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,265
Whoa. Whoa!

320
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,834
So that means I...

321
00:20:34,836 --> 00:20:36,171
I'm...

322
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,772
Wait, Bethany.
Bethany, don't!

323
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:42,610
No!

324
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,082
I'm an overweight,
middle-aged man.

325
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,784
Uh, I have a tattoo.

326
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:53,653
My mom always said she'd
kill me if I ever got a tattoo.

327
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:55,021
What is this?

328
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:56,724
I have one too.

329
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:00,393
Sometimes.

330
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:02,762
Wait a second.

331
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:05,231
Where's my phone?

332
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:08,668
Aah.

333
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,737
Why am I wearing this outfit
in a jungle?

334
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:13,140
Tiny, little shorts
and a leather halter top.

335
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:14,708
I mean, what is this?

336
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,076
I look like a living
garden gnome. Where is my phone?

337
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:19,680
- Who cares?
- We are in different bodies!

338
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:22,114
It doesn't seem like
the most pressing concern

339
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:24,050
- at this moment.
- Really? You don't think

340
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:26,118
this would be a good moment
to make a call

341
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,020
or text somebody
or change your status

342
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:29,355
to "stuck in a video game"?

343
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:32,759
All I'm saying is,
I don't have my Claritin, okay?

344
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:34,694
And I'm allergic to
almost everything.

345
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:36,028
Oh, no.

346
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,765
You got allergies,
Spencer? Huh?

347
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,767
I don't have the top two feet
of my body!

348
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:43,470
You guys, this can't
actually be happening.

349
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:46,038
Maybe we're all in a coma.

350
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,009
Together?
We're all in a coma together?

351
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:51,310
It's the only explanation.
That old game machine

352
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:53,814
must have electrocuted us,
and now we're...

353
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:58,818
- Oh, my God, Bethany!
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!

354
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,187
Stop it!

355
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:10,063
Oh, my God! You better get
in there and go save her.

356
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:11,964
I'm not getting in there!
You get in.

357
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm not going anywhere.
I got a backpack on.

358
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:16,737
You don't get in water with a
backpack. Everybody knows that.

359
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,011
Ow!

360
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,213
What the...?

361
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:29,819
- Bethany!
- What just...?

362
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:32,452
Are you okay?

363
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:34,820
That was so intense.

364
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:36,790
I, like, can't even
with this place.

365
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:39,093
- What just happened to you?
- I got eaten by a rhino,

366
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:41,828
and then I fell, like,
a thousand feet from the sky.

367
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,529
Yeah, that's what
it looked like.

368
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:45,433
That was a hippo.
They're omnivorous.

369
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:47,933
They're fast as a horse
over short distances,

370
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:50,305
and they have the bite force
of 8100 newtons.

371
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,239
How do I know this?

372
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:53,775
You're an expert in zoology.

373
00:22:53,777 --> 00:22:55,541
- What?
- I'm still an old fat guy, right?

374
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:58,078
- I'm afraid so.
- Wait.

375
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,349
Why is everybody okay with this?
I mean, she fell out of the sky.

376
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:03,954
Um, guys?

377
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:11,558
Bethany, get up.
Bethany, get up. Get up!

378
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:18,900
Go, go, go!

379
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:21,102
Go, go, go!

380
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:28,011
Ah! Dr. Bravestone!
Welcome to Jumanji!

381
00:23:29,846 --> 00:23:32,413
Don't just stand there.
In you go.

382
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:34,182
- Go, go, go.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:47,494
Dr. Bravestone.

384
00:23:47,496 --> 00:23:50,530
Famed archaeologist
and international explorer.

385
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,166
Known across
the seven continents

386
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:54,035
for your courageous exploits.

387
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:56,002
Is there a seat belt?

388
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:59,106
I can't tell you what an honor
it is to finally meet you.

389
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:02,442
I'm not embarrassed to say
you're more dashing in person.

390
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:04,478
Um, thanks.

391
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,579
Who are you?

392
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:07,215
Nigel Billingsly
at your service,

393
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:09,483
Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men.

394
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:11,184
Welcome to Jumanji.

395
00:24:11,186 --> 00:24:14,422
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

396
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:16,523
As you know,
Jumanji is in grave danger.

397
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,427
We're counting on the four
of you to lift the curse.

398
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:21,163
- Curse?
- What curse?

399
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:24,332
Excuse me.
Have you seen my phone anywhere?

400
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:26,934
Professor Sheldon Oberon.

401
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:28,469
Welcome to Jumanji.

402
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:30,404
Nigel Billingsly
at your service.

403
00:24:30,406 --> 00:24:33,008
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

404
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,542
What's with this guy?

405
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:36,345
I think he's an NPC.

406
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:37,879
A what? English, please.

407
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:39,982
A non-player character.
He's part of the game.

408
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:41,348
So anything we ask him,

409
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,651
he only has his programmed
series of responses.

410
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:45,386
Got it. It's all clear now.

411
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:47,588
Franklin "Mouse" Finbar.

412
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,155
Welcome to Jumanji.

413
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,992
It's Moose. It's not Mouse.

414
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:53,494
No, good sir.
I'm quite sure it's Mouse.

415
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:55,062
- Mouse?
- A nickname given

416
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:57,933
for your diminutive stature
and adorable manner.

417
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:59,100
I knew you'd be here.

418
00:24:59,102 --> 00:25:00,934
Dr. Bravestone
doesn't go anywhere

419
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:02,637
without his trusty sidekick.

420
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,238
Sidekick?

421
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,241
Ever since Dr. Bravestone
rescued you

422
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,643
from the clutches of a warlord

423
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:10,479
in the jungles of Peru,
you've never left his side.

424
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:11,646
Right.

425
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:13,382
Can we go back
to the curse thing?

426
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:15,917
It's all documented
in the letter I sent you.

427
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,519
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

428
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:19,090
I don't have a let...

429
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:23,427
Whoa.

430
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:29,064
Right, uh...

431
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:31,400
"Dr. Bravestone,
I am writing to you

432
00:25:31,402 --> 00:25:33,502
"regarding
the desperate situation

433
00:25:33,504 --> 00:25:36,305
In Jumanji.
We need your help at once."

434
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:39,273
- Whoa... Guys?
- What's happening?

435
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:41,243
What the hell is going on?

436
00:25:41,245 --> 00:25:43,611
It's a cut scene.
A lot of games have them.

437
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:46,414
It's like a little movie
to tell you the back-story.

438
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:48,517
My name is Nigel Billingsly,

439
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,020
Jumanji field guide.

440
00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:53,089
I was hired
by your former partner,

441
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:55,723
now nemesis,
Professor Russel Van Pelt

442
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:57,463
to lead a fateful expedition.

443
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:03,231
You see, Professor Van Pelt

444
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,567
had come in search
of the fabled Jaguar Shrine,

445
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:09,237
resting place
of the sacred jewel of Jumanji.

446
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:11,272
As you know better than anyone,

447
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:13,107
the jewel was his
great obsession.

448
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:15,309
And after years of research,
he believed

449
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:17,311
that he had discovered
its whereabouts.

450
00:26:17,313 --> 00:26:19,081
Could it be?

451
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,184
Have I finally found it?

452
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:24,387
Van Pelt told me that
he wanted to find the jewel

453
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:27,090
in order to document it
in his writings.

454
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:31,659
- It's real!
- What I did not know

455
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:35,500
was that he intended
to take the jewel for himself.

456
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:47,076
I found it.

457
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:51,215
I found it!

458
00:26:52,751 --> 00:26:56,219
Legend tells that the
Jaguar watches over Jumanji

459
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:58,387
and anyone who dares
to blind him

460
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:01,960
will be consumed
by a dark power.

461
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:05,094
Van Pelt assumed dominion

462
00:27:05,096 --> 00:27:07,195
over all of Jumanji's creatures,

463
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:10,500
possessing them,
controlling them.

464
00:27:10,502 --> 00:27:15,107
And a terrible curse befell
this once-placid land.

465
00:27:16,507 --> 00:27:18,540
I begged him to put it back,

466
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,675
but once he had it in his grasp,

467
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:24,480
he could never let it go.

468
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:27,617
So I waited
till they slept that night,

469
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:29,355
and I made my move.

470
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,542
Bring me that jewel!

471
00:27:53,544 --> 00:27:57,148
And slaughter anyone
who tries to stop you.

472
00:27:58,183 --> 00:28:00,219
Right, then. Here you go.

473
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:04,088
With the invaluable help
of your associates,

474
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,856
you must use your
complementary skills

475
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,823
to return the jewel
to the Jaguar's eye

476
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,194
and lift the curse.

477
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,529
I'm sure you'll want
to get started right away.

478
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:14,429
- Actually, I think...
- Good luck!

479
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,566
The fate of Jumanji
is in your hands.

480
00:28:18,503 --> 00:28:20,236
- What? Oh...
- And remember:

481
00:28:20,238 --> 00:28:22,473
The goal for you,
I'll recite in verse

482
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:25,108
Return the jewel
and lift the curse

483
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,676
If you wish to leave the game

484
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:31,247
You must save Jumanji
And call out its name

485
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:34,217
Good luck! The fate
of Jumanji is in your hands.

486
00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:36,552
- And remember:
- He's saying the same thing over.

487
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:38,186
I'll recite in verse

488
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:40,322
Return the jewel
and lift the curse

489
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:41,524
If you wish to leave the game

490
00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:45,597
You must save Jumanji
And call out its name

491
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:52,269
It's okay. You can handle this.
In real life, people love you.

492
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:53,803
You can hook up
with anyone you want.

493
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:56,473
Is that what you tell yourself
when you're scared?

494
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,841
Can you not judge me
for two seconds?

495
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,878
I split up with Noah,
I turned into a guy,

496
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,613
and I cannot find my phone.
I am allowed to be upset.

497
00:29:03,615 --> 00:29:06,750
Dr. Bravestone,
here's a map of Jumanji.

498
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:09,520
You must go to the bazaar
and find the missing piece.

499
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:11,588
- The bazaar.
- Missing piece of what?

500
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,590
- Cheerio!
- You can't give us a ride

501
00:29:13,592 --> 00:29:15,559
- to the statue?
- And remember:

502
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:17,528
If you wish to leave the game

503
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,469
You must save Jumanji
And call out its name

504
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:32,276
- You want to, uh, put this in there?
- No.

505
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:35,347
Come on, you're the only one
with a backpack, Fridge.

506
00:29:36,314 --> 00:29:37,916
So what? We have a map.

507
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:39,917
So now we're supposed
to go and find...?

508
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,417
The bazaar, I guess?

509
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,354
So we return the jewel
to the Jaguar statue,

510
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:46,889
and then we go home.
No problem.

511
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:48,825
Why can't we just leave,
stop the game,

512
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:50,895
without doing all this stuff?

513
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:53,399
We have to finish the game.

514
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:56,303
I think...

515
00:29:57,469 --> 00:30:00,406
I think we have to save Jumanji.

516
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:11,485
Damn, that is a man right there.

517
00:30:13,652 --> 00:30:17,889
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

518
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:18,956
Don't cry.

519
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,425
Ah...

520
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:23,227
There are so many diseases
out here.

521
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:24,661
It's hot.

522
00:30:24,663 --> 00:30:26,898
Okay, this is what I'm good at.

523
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,299
Playing video games.
It's what I do.

524
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:31,568
It's literally
the main thing that I do.

525
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,637
Play a game like this,
there'll be levels.

526
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:36,440
In order to finish, you gotta
complete all the levels.

527
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:38,508
Levels are gonna get harder
as we go along.

528
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,977
- We complete the levels...
- Do you

529
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,812
even know where we're going?

530
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:43,680
- Kind of.
- Kind of?

531
00:30:43,682 --> 00:30:46,583
Oh, that's good, then.
We're in good hands.

532
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:49,454
Okay, the missing piece,
I'm guessing.

533
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:51,321
That must be
what we're looking for,

534
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:52,590
the missing piece of the map.

535
00:30:52,592 --> 00:30:54,628
The problem is,
there's nothing here.

536
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:00,331
What do you mean?
It's a map, just like he said.

537
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,735
It's a map of Jumanji.

538
00:31:03,036 --> 00:31:04,502
Cartography.

539
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:06,504
- What's that?
- The study of maps.

540
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:08,639
It was one of
Professor Oberon's skills.

541
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:09,841
Yes. That's right.

542
00:31:09,843 --> 00:31:12,476
Oh, so you can't see this,
but I can?

543
00:31:12,478 --> 00:31:15,046
The characters we chose,
we all have certain skills.

544
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:17,049
So there's gotta be
a way to access our...

545
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:20,220
Oh!

546
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:22,853
Wow.

547
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:24,354
What'd you just do?

548
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:26,623
"Strengths:
Fearless. Climbing.

549
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,493
Speed. Boomerang.

550
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:30,994
Smoldering intensity."

551
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,601
What the hell are you doing?

552
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,707
- What just happened?
- Um, you just smoldered.

553
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:42,409
"Weakness.

554
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:45,008
None"?

555
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,745
How'd you do that?
That, uh, list?

556
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:52,950
Well, I just... I think I just
pressed my enormous left pec.

557
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,387
It's like the boob area.
Let me show you.

558
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:56,587
Get away from me.

559
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,390
At least press it
in front of us...

560
00:31:58,392 --> 00:32:00,525
...so we know exactly how...

561
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:05,429
"Strengths: Karate. T'ai chi.
Aikido. Dance fighting"?

562
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:07,799
Dance fighting?
Is that even a thing?

563
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,667
"Weakness:

564
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:10,935
Venom."

565
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,674
Seriously?

566
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:19,078
"Paleontology."
What does that even mean?

567
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,812
Study of fossils, I think.

568
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,783
- That's kind of cool.
- Says the gorgeous karate badass

569
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:27,686
to the old fossil guy
who doesn't have any endurance.

570
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,792
I hate this game.

571
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:36,061
"Weakness: Cake."

572
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:39,097
Yes, cake is my weakness.

573
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:41,800
Along with speed and strength.

574
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:42,834
Huh...

575
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,703
Strength is my weakness.

576
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:47,072
Hey, can I...?
Quick question.

577
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:48,873
How is strength my weakness?

578
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:52,009
Somebody explain that to me.
And why would I need speed?

579
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,713
Why would I need to be fast
when I'm being chased

580
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:58,484
by an enormous killer zebra or
some shit in this dumb-ass hat?

581
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:00,853
You're also
a good weapons valet.

582
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:04,023
- What does that mean?
- Well, I think it means

583
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,858
you carry my weapons
in your backpack,

584
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,598
and you give them to me
when and if I need them?

585
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:14,933
You guys. The map,
it's changing.

586
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:16,135
What do you mean?

587
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:17,736
- What's it say?
- Okay, well,

588
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:19,171
there's not
a lot of information.

589
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:22,140
But a minute ago, it didn't
say this and now it does.

590
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:25,612
It says,
"The Mighty Roar."

591
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:34,986
I don't like that.

592
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:36,921
- I'm done.
- What else?

593
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:40,826
Okay. And right here,
it says "From The Deep."

594
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:43,129
The hippo came from the deep.
The one that...

595
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:46,599
Yes, the thing that did
the thing. That's it. Moving on.

596
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:48,802
So if "From The Deep"
is the first level,

597
00:33:48,804 --> 00:33:51,737
then "The Mighty Roar" must be
the second level.

598
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,773
Which way?

599
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:55,175
Okay.

600
00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:57,645
If that is that...

601
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,450
and that is here...

602
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:03,949
Right here, I think.

603
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:18,733
What is this game?

604
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:21,770
Run!

605
00:34:24,038 --> 00:34:25,573
Wait!

606
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:31,913
Ha!

607
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:44,727
Come on, legs!

608
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:49,464
Why am I running so slow?

609
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:57,005
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

610
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,978
Aah!
This sucks!

611
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:06,848
Split up!

612
00:35:20,962 --> 00:35:22,532
Oh, my God.

613
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:39,782
Aah!

614
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,184
Whoa.

615
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:46,619
Come on!

616
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:48,322
- Those guys have huge guns.
- Oh, really?

617
00:35:48,324 --> 00:35:49,889
Is that what those are, Spencer?

618
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,724
- Let me see your backpack.
- For what?

619
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:53,927
Inside your backpack,
you have my weapons.

620
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,065
Get down.

621
00:35:57,967 --> 00:36:00,300
Got your weapons?

622
00:36:00,302 --> 00:36:02,802
I can't feel no...
What's this?

623
00:36:02,804 --> 00:36:05,104
Oh, yes. Boomerang,
it's one of my strengths.

624
00:36:05,106 --> 00:36:06,639
What are you gonna do with it?

625
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:08,175
I don't know.
Kill them, I guess.

626
00:36:08,177 --> 00:36:09,208
Kill them with that?

627
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,311
You got a better idea?

628
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:11,913
Oh, watch yourself.

629
00:36:13,248 --> 00:36:14,247
Watch this.

630
00:36:18,352 --> 00:36:20,621
- Nice work.
- There!

631
00:36:20,623 --> 00:36:22,356
Want me to see
if I got a hacky sack

632
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:24,628
for you to throw
and do nothing with?

633
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:38,371
Oh!

634
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:41,075
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, no.

635
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,684
It worked.

636
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:50,919
Here they come. We gotta go.

637
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:52,688
I can't outrun those guys.

638
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:55,822
We gotta go now!

639
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:57,858
- Get on my back.
- I would rather die.

640
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,392
- Jump on my back!
- Nope. I'll die.

641
00:36:59,394 --> 00:37:01,128
Put me down!

642
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,868
Spencer! Put me down!

643
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,977
Whew!

644
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:18,648
You have got to be kidding me.

645
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,085
Oh, no, no, no!

646
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:28,122
- We have to jump!
- Are you out of your mind?

647
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:30,423
I would rather do
anything else now but that.

648
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:32,426
Jump!

649
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:34,328
- Martha!
- Jump!

650
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,866
We gotta jump!

651
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:40,000
We don't know
how deep that water is.

652
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:41,870
- We gotta go!
- No, no!

653
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:45,742
- You gonna jump. Jump!
- No!

654
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:06,026
Oh! I think
I'm having a coronary.

655
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:07,761
I'm having difficulty breathing.

656
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:10,464
That was the most
humiliating moment of my life.

657
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:12,466
Don't you do that again.

658
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:14,301
I took in a lot of water.

659
00:38:19,276 --> 00:38:21,142
They got me.

660
00:38:21,144 --> 00:38:22,912
Oh, no.

661
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:25,649
Martha?

662
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:35,058
- Wait, what just happened to her?
- Is she dead? Did she die?

663
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:39,928
Wait a second.

664
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,164
What the hell is hap...?

665
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,331
Ow!

666
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,200
- Get off of my back!
- Are you okay?

667
00:38:45,202 --> 00:38:47,267
- I think so.
- Off of me!

668
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:49,937
- Goodness gracious, get off!
- I'm getting off of you.

669
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,172
Anybody care if I'm okay?

670
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:53,210
What am I, a human landing pad?

671
00:38:56,178 --> 00:38:57,480
That's what I thought.

672
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,080
We each have three lives, guys.

673
00:38:59,082 --> 00:39:01,982
These little tattoos
on our arms...

674
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:04,518
Jesus, would you look
at the size of that thing?

675
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,288
- Spencer!
- What?

676
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,758
- You were saying?
- It's our life count.

677
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,060
Bethany got eaten by a hippo,
so now she only has two lines.

678
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:14,328
He's right.

679
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,835
Wait. What happens
if we use up all our lives?

680
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:21,705
Well, usually that would mean...

681
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,472
...game over.

682
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:26,207
What do you mean, "game over"?

683
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:28,978
Are you saying that
we can actually die in here?

684
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,846
I mean, I don't know
for sure, but...

685
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:32,347
You're not sure?
You're not sure,

686
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:35,284
- Mr. Video-Game-Genius?
- I've never been stuck in one!

687
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:40,556
So I'm not certain, but, yes,
I'm afraid we all could die.

688
00:39:42,526 --> 00:39:45,063
That is my big concern
right now.

689
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:51,567
We better find
the missing piece, then.

690
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:53,739
Okay.

691
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:57,840
It looks like there's a village

692
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,541
on the other side
of this mountain.

693
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:01,577
Maybe that's the bazaar.

694
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:04,049
- Let's do it.
- Wait.

695
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:07,115
I gotta take a leak first.

696
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:10,286
I've been dreading this all day,

697
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:12,886
but so do I.

698
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:16,027
Can I come with you
and you show me how it's done?

699
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:19,394
I may need your help.

700
00:40:19,396 --> 00:40:25,201
Uh, yeah, sure.
Yeah, I'm... I'll help you out.

701
00:40:27,538 --> 00:40:29,538
So how do we do this?

702
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,472
Uh. Easy.
You just, uh...

703
00:40:31,474 --> 00:40:33,909
You unzip, take it out,
fire away.

704
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:37,884
Remember to aim.
It's very important.

705
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:42,483
My God, you guys,
there is literally a penis

706
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:43,985
attached to my body right now.

707
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:45,588
Martha, come look at my penis!

708
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,389
No, thanks.

709
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:50,226
- This the first you've seen it?
- Yes. I didn't wanna look.

710
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:52,928
I looked at mine
the first 20 seconds here.

711
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,396
I'm happy to report
that I was able

712
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:56,934
to bring one thing
from the outside world.

713
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:59,602
Are you...? What are you doing?

714
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:00,969
- Are you looking?
- Sorry.

715
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:02,237
You don't look over!

716
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,472
Yeah, you never look.
It's a thing.

717
00:41:04,474 --> 00:41:06,374
Okay, good boy.

718
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,377
We're gonna take this
nice and slow,

719
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:09,644
and nobody's gonna get hurt.

720
00:41:09,646 --> 00:41:11,448
- Now what?
- Now blast off.

721
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,947
And aim.
Don't forget to aim.

722
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:15,050
What is with you and aiming?
What happened?

723
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:16,653
Can we not talk about this?

724
00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:19,554
Wow, wow, wow!

725
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:21,956
Oh, this is so much easier!

726
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,459
It's cool, right?

727
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:26,094
Yeah, because you have,
like, a handle.

728
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:28,564
The fact that I'm not
Instagramming this

729
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:30,267
right now is insane.

730
00:41:33,138 --> 00:41:35,238
- This looks all right.
- Up ahead!

731
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,127
Bravestone.

732
00:41:57,129 --> 00:41:59,198
Him and that whole lot.

733
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:01,901
They got away?

734
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,269
We lost them in the jungle.

735
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:07,039
I should have known.

736
00:42:09,474 --> 00:42:12,042
H-how do you mean, sir?

737
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:15,312
I will summon every creature
and every soldier

738
00:42:15,314 --> 00:42:17,379
to hunt them down.

739
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:20,118
Reclaim what is mine.

740
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:24,891
Find them.

741
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:30,459
Be careful of the ground, guys.

742
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:33,196
It's uneven. I'd hate
for anybody to twist an ankle.

743
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:35,365
- I did that once...
- Please stop talking?

744
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:37,968
- Okay, sure. No problem.
- Please!

745
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,669
- Can I borrow your jacket?
- Yeah, sure.

746
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:41,172
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?

747
00:42:41,174 --> 00:42:43,439
I feel like I'm wearing
a bikini at school.

748
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:45,709
I did that once.
They sent me to the office.

749
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:47,142
Of course.

750
00:42:47,144 --> 00:42:49,011
Noah likes it
when I show some skin.

751
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:50,715
It's like the key
to our relationship.

752
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:52,448
Ew.

753
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,320
Judgy much? Seriously, I can't
even open my mouth around you.

754
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:59,724
You don't even know me, but you,
like, decided you hate me.

755
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:02,228
Oh, wait a minute.
I don't hate you.

756
00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:06,296
- You don't?
- No.

757
00:43:06,298 --> 00:43:08,598
Look, I just think
you live in, like,

758
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,066
the "hot popular girl" bubble.

759
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:11,634
Where everybody
either treats you

760
00:43:11,636 --> 00:43:13,704
like a princess
or like an object.

761
00:43:13,706 --> 00:43:18,946
Maybe it makes you a little...
self-absorbed or something?

762
00:43:22,114 --> 00:43:24,013
That's fair.

763
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:26,115
But do you think maybe
the reason why you're

764
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:28,619
so judgy is because
you're, like, afraid that

765
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:30,087
people aren't gonna like you,

766
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:32,155
so you decide
not to like them first?

767
00:43:32,157 --> 00:43:34,194
No.

768
00:43:35,027 --> 00:43:38,063
Maybe. Maybe.

769
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,231
Okay, then.

770
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:44,103
I'm just saying,
you're a babe. Own it.

771
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:47,736
Thanks.

772
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:49,706
I guess.

773
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:59,516
So sick of this game.
Just stay out of my way, Spencer.

774
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:01,351
What are you mad at me for?

775
00:44:01,353 --> 00:44:03,487
Why? Are you
seriously asking me that?

776
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:05,288
You got me kicked off the team.

777
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,525
Then you got me stuck in
whatever... Whatever this is.

778
00:44:08,527 --> 00:44:10,561
And you wonder
why we not friends no more.

779
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:12,496
This is why
we're not friends anymore?

780
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:15,331
You didn't wanna get stuck
in Jumanji? I don't think so.

781
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,467
We're not friends
because I'm not cool enough

782
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:19,402
to hang out with you,
so you pretended

783
00:44:19,404 --> 00:44:21,639
not to even know me anymore,
until you needed me

784
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:24,308
to do your homework because
you couldn't do it yourself.

785
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:25,843
No wonder
you don't know anything

786
00:44:25,845 --> 00:44:27,244
about westward expansion.

787
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:29,612
Okay, you see that?
You know what?

788
00:44:29,614 --> 00:44:31,216
I'm not stupid, Spencer.

789
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:33,285
I asked you to do me
one simple favor.

790
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:34,652
Do my homework, so I don't

791
00:44:34,654 --> 00:44:37,253
get kicked off the team,
and you messed that up.

792
00:44:37,255 --> 00:44:39,556
Now I can't do the one thing
that I'm good at,

793
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:41,826
and it's all your fault.

794
00:44:41,828 --> 00:44:44,265
I should kick
the shit out you right now.

795
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:53,637
I'd like to see you try.

796
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:55,043
What did you say?

797
00:44:56,842 --> 00:44:59,310
Oh, okay.

798
00:44:59,312 --> 00:45:00,844
I see what's going on here.

799
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:02,481
Guys.

800
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:04,850
You think because you...
You, what, 6'4 ", 6'5",

801
00:45:04,852 --> 00:45:06,382
270 pounds of pure muscle,

802
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:08,153
I'm supposed
to be afraid of you?

803
00:45:08,155 --> 00:45:09,524
Is that what you think?

804
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:12,193
Maybe.

805
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:18,329
Let me tell you something.

806
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:20,131
You're still
the same annoying kid

807
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,469
I've been trying to shake
since seventh grade.

808
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,269
Ain't nothing changed.

809
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:28,472
Don't let this new body
get your butt whupped.

810
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,249
Dumb-ass.

811
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:42,854
- No!
- Spencer!

812
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:44,689
Spencer!

813
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:47,292
- You killed him!
- Fridge, you lunatic!

814
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:49,464
Chill out. He'll be back.

815
00:46:07,315 --> 00:46:09,149
Don't call me a dumb-ass.

816
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:12,216
Don't push me.

817
00:46:12,218 --> 00:46:13,617
Or what, Spencer?

818
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,489
Or I'll push you back.

819
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:25,398
- Oh!
- Oh!

820
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:29,504
Did you just smack me?

821
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,571
You gonna smack me?

822
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:35,974
- Fridge, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

823
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:37,710
Huh? You wanna smack...?

824
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:40,413
Oh, no, no, no!

825
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:42,550
Enough.

826
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:45,520
We can't waste lives.

827
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,220
We need each other.

828
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:52,757
Like it or not,
we have to do this together.

829
00:46:55,964 --> 00:46:57,796
Could you say that
one more time, please?

830
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:00,632
- We have to do this together?
- But with the smolder.

831
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:04,501
Do you have control of that,
or does that happen naturally?

832
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:06,504
It just happens naturally.

833
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:37,335
What are we supposed
to be doing?

834
00:47:37,337 --> 00:47:38,904
Looking for
the missing map piece.

835
00:47:38,906 --> 00:47:40,605
So we just start asking for it?

836
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,275
No, I think we look around,
scope the place out,

837
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,344
but most importantly, guys,

838
00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:47,248
be discreet.

839
00:47:48,016 --> 00:47:50,750
Rations! Get your rations!

840
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:53,451
Does anyone have any money?
I'm literally starving.

841
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,589
Rations! Get your rations!

842
00:47:56,591 --> 00:47:58,723
Rations!

843
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:00,993
Guys, I think the game
is trying to tell us

844
00:48:00,995 --> 00:48:02,060
to keep our health up.

845
00:48:02,062 --> 00:48:04,030
We need to eat.

846
00:48:04,032 --> 00:48:05,764
Okay, stop doing that.

847
00:48:05,766 --> 00:48:07,366
Oh, my God, this is so good.

848
00:48:07,368 --> 00:48:09,369
I haven't had bread
since I was, like, 9.

849
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:10,503
Are you serious?

850
00:48:10,505 --> 00:48:12,606
How do you think
I got these abs?

851
00:48:12,608 --> 00:48:14,543
Let me try some of that.

852
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:17,245
Mm.

853
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,813
Wait, what...?
What is this?

854
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,081
That's my famous pound cake.

855
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:25,317
Cake?

856
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,787
Bethany, you said
this was bread.

857
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:29,388
It's been so long,
I forgot what it tastes like.

858
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:30,855
How do you forget what...?

859
00:48:30,857 --> 00:48:33,058
What's hap...
Something happening to me?

860
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,593
- No.
- Am I... Am I shaking?

861
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:36,061
- Huh-uh.
- Am I breaking out?

862
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:37,929
No.

863
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:40,098
- Am I still black?
- Yes.

864
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,802
Okay. Okay, right?

865
00:48:43,804 --> 00:48:45,971
We're fine.
Everything is fine.

866
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:47,474
Yeah, no, no, no, it's okay.

867
00:48:47,476 --> 00:48:49,443
It probably just meant
that I love cake.

868
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:51,409
That I couldn't resist it.
Yeah.

869
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:53,511
Hey, it's all good...

870
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:08,095
God!

871
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:10,997
Oh! Ow!

872
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:12,769
What the hell? Ugh!

873
00:49:14,067 --> 00:49:16,001
Like I said,
important to be discreet.

874
00:49:16,003 --> 00:49:17,470
Hey, you also said eat.

875
00:49:17,472 --> 00:49:19,106
Rations!
Get your...

876
00:49:19,108 --> 00:49:20,743
You better shut your ass up!

877
00:49:22,443 --> 00:49:24,844
Dr. Bravestone.
Thank goodness you're here.

878
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:26,046
Jumanji needs you.

879
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:29,782
Uh. Thanks. Good to be here.

880
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:31,450
Ask about the missing piece.

881
00:49:31,452 --> 00:49:33,585
Oh, right.
Hi. I'm Bethany.

882
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:36,756
I mean...
Professor Shelly, something.

883
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:38,157
I'm a map doctor,

884
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,727
and I have this map that,
like, has a missing piece.

885
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,097
Dr. Bravestone.
Thank goodness you're here.

886
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:45,432
Jumanji needs you.

887
00:49:45,434 --> 00:49:46,700
Rude.

888
00:49:46,702 --> 00:49:49,472
We need to find
the missing piece.

889
00:50:23,005 --> 00:50:26,641
What you need is in the basket

890
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:29,443
One false move,
you're in a casket

891
00:50:29,445 --> 00:50:32,778
Trust one another,
and never blink

892
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,620
The missing piece
is not what you think

893
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:38,985
Oy vey.

894
00:50:38,987 --> 00:50:40,888
Good luck, mighty hero.

895
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,190
- Jumanji needs you.
- Jumanji needs him. We know.

896
00:50:43,192 --> 00:50:45,395
You said it several times.

897
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:54,768
So thinking there's a, um...

898
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:57,237
A snake in there or something?

899
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:58,671
Yep.

900
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:00,574
Sounds like
a Bravestone thing to me.

901
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:02,477
Why would this be
a Bravestone thing?

902
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:04,244
You're the hero.
You heard what he said.

903
00:51:04,246 --> 00:51:05,848
"Jumanji needs you."
Now, get.

904
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,498
I don't wanna do this!

905
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,665
Just go.

906
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:47,554
Black mamba!

907
00:51:47,556 --> 00:51:49,524
That's a black mamba.

908
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:52,058
A quarter milligram of its venom
is enough to kill an adult.

909
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,261
You'll feel a tingling
in your mouth and extremities,

910
00:51:54,263 --> 00:51:56,797
followed by a fever, foaming
at the mouth, and ataxia,

911
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,566
which means
loss of muscle control.

912
00:51:58,568 --> 00:52:00,134
- How do I know that?
- What do we do?

913
00:52:00,136 --> 00:52:02,603
- See anything else in there?
- I didn't have time.

914
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:04,005
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

915
00:52:04,007 --> 00:52:06,707
"Trust one another
and never blink." Never blink.

916
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:09,777
You guys, I think
it's a staring contest.

917
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:11,279
- What?
- What are you talking about?

918
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:14,214
- Think about it. "Never blink"?
- Guys, I think she's right.

919
00:52:14,216 --> 00:52:15,883
At camp, they used to tell us

920
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:18,186
if you see a rattlesnake,
don't move. I think someone

921
00:52:18,188 --> 00:52:20,888
has to make direct eye contact
and not blink.

922
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:22,823
And then Spencer
will reach in and grab

923
00:52:22,825 --> 00:52:25,292
- whatever else is in there.
- What? Why me again?

924
00:52:25,294 --> 00:52:27,628
- Because you're Bravestone.
- Okay, fine.

925
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,001
Who's good at staring
and not blinking?

926
00:52:32,935 --> 00:52:34,202
I'm amazing at it.

927
00:52:34,204 --> 00:52:36,170
Then this is your moment.

928
00:52:39,308 --> 00:52:41,645
Come on, Bethany.

929
00:52:46,182 --> 00:52:47,518
Okay.

930
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,055
Just say when.

931
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:56,027
Now.

932
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,266
Oh!

933
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:08,538
What do we do?

934
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,307
You gotta defang it.

935
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:14,943
I gotta what?

936
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:16,644
You gotta pull his mouth back

937
00:53:16,646 --> 00:53:18,613
from the blind spot
to disorient it.

938
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:20,615
But be very careful
of the venom gland

939
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:22,717
and the exposed
secondary venom duct.

940
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:24,251
Then you gotta snap its teeth...

941
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:28,322
...out of its head.

942
00:53:28,324 --> 00:53:30,961
Oh, oh!

943
00:53:33,097 --> 00:53:35,831
I guess it wasn't
a staring contest.

944
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:39,101
"Trust each other
and never blink."

945
00:53:39,103 --> 00:53:41,168
You trusted me.

946
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,371
You trusted me,
and I defanged the snake.

947
00:53:43,373 --> 00:53:45,307
I did it.
I did that.

948
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,943
Yeah.
Yeah, you did it.

949
00:53:47,945 --> 00:53:49,378
Thank you.

950
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,984
Oh, yeah. Sure.

951
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:03,926
You guys?

952
00:54:03,928 --> 00:54:06,394
This does not look like
a piece of a map.

953
00:54:06,396 --> 00:54:09,831
The missing piece
is an elephant?

954
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:12,800
Oh, wait, there's something
written on the wrapping paper.

955
00:54:12,802 --> 00:54:16,104
"When you see me,
begin the climb."

956
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:20,012
"Begin the climb"?
When you see an elephant?

957
00:54:22,147 --> 00:54:24,012
I defanged a snake.

958
00:54:25,816 --> 00:54:28,951
So keep your eyes
peeled for an elephant, I guess?

959
00:54:28,953 --> 00:54:31,219
That's, like,
the next level of the game?

960
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:38,895
Hey!

961
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:40,198
Run!

962
00:54:44,467 --> 00:54:46,767
Oh, God.

963
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:48,806
Watch out!

964
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:52,240
Jump!

965
00:54:52,242 --> 00:54:54,046
- Jump.
- Go, go, go!

966
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:56,080
Hey!

967
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,122
I have to warn you, I think
I'm a very strong puncher.

968
00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:08,192
Parry.

969
00:55:09,327 --> 00:55:12,027
Parry. Parry. Evade. Block.

970
00:55:12,029 --> 00:55:13,328
Uppercut.

971
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,237
Oh. Oh.

972
00:55:19,337 --> 00:55:21,069
Duck! Head smash!

973
00:55:23,308 --> 00:55:24,306
Kerpow!

974
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:29,178
Duck! Block!

975
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,683
Ka-blam!

976
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:34,750
Evade! Punch!

977
00:55:34,752 --> 00:55:37,386
Wall toss!

978
00:55:37,388 --> 00:55:39,792
That is insane.

979
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:50,065
Let's do this.

980
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:51,035
Do what?

981
00:55:52,437 --> 00:55:55,141
Put... Put it
in my backpack.

982
00:55:56,175 --> 00:55:58,875
Dodge! Head slam!

983
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:00,109
Throw through ceiling!

984
00:56:09,054 --> 00:56:10,155
- Ah! - Ah!
- Ah!

985
00:56:25,404 --> 00:56:27,871
Hello, doctor.

986
00:56:27,873 --> 00:56:29,976
Been a long time.

987
00:56:32,509 --> 00:56:36,282
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

988
00:56:37,483 --> 00:56:39,181
We just wanna go home.

989
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:46,523
Come on! Come with me! Hurry!

990
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:47,890
Get him!

991
00:56:55,366 --> 00:56:56,836
Come on.

992
00:57:00,905 --> 00:57:03,809
Down here.
Come on. Quick!

993
00:57:19,592 --> 00:57:21,057
Shh!

994
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:22,425
Okay.

995
00:57:22,427 --> 00:57:25,429
I need you to follow me
and do exactly as I say.

996
00:57:25,431 --> 00:57:28,298
Let's move.

997
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,034
Oh, my God, you guys,
I am so stoked you are here.

998
00:57:31,036 --> 00:57:33,370
- You have no idea. So stoked.
- You are?

999
00:57:33,372 --> 00:57:35,371
I mean, I saw you
guys in the bazaar,

1000
00:57:35,373 --> 00:57:37,206
and I thought
to myself, "No way."

1001
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,008
Then I was like, yeah, that's...

1002
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,948
Backs against the wall!

1003
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,949
Oh, my goodness!

1004
00:57:46,385 --> 00:57:48,087
Let's keep moving.

1005
00:57:49,255 --> 00:57:51,621
- Watch your step in here.
- Um, who are you?

1006
00:57:51,623 --> 00:57:53,091
And who do you think we are?

1007
00:57:53,093 --> 00:57:55,093
Right.
Sorry, okay, my bad.

1008
00:57:55,095 --> 00:57:57,160
Um. Let me back up
a little bit here.

1009
00:57:57,162 --> 00:57:59,330
Wait, are you the pilot?
"Seaplane" somebody?

1010
00:57:59,332 --> 00:58:01,264
- Yeah, that's me.
- Wait a minute.

1011
00:58:01,266 --> 00:58:03,333
You're the other
character that was taken.

1012
00:58:03,335 --> 00:58:06,503
- So you're in the game too?
- Stay off the white bricks...

1013
00:58:06,505 --> 00:58:07,971
- What?
- And freeze.

1014
00:58:07,973 --> 00:58:09,639
- Aah!
- Oh!

1015
00:58:15,313 --> 00:58:17,649
So gnarly.

1016
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:20,254
This game sucks.

1017
00:58:22,354 --> 00:58:23,956
Hup!

1018
00:58:29,128 --> 00:58:32,132
All right. Get this plank.

1019
00:58:36,502 --> 00:58:39,036
Follow me.

1020
00:58:39,038 --> 00:58:41,571
Careful.
It's a horrible way to die.

1021
00:58:41,573 --> 00:58:43,877
Oh, God.

1022
00:58:45,444 --> 00:58:47,046
There you go. All right.

1023
00:58:53,954 --> 00:58:55,320
Come on.

1024
00:58:56,722 --> 00:58:59,256
I got it, I got it.
I just defanged a snake.

1025
00:58:59,258 --> 00:59:01,194
Give me a little respect.

1026
00:59:06,298 --> 00:59:08,299
Okay.

1027
00:59:17,142 --> 00:59:19,914
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1028
00:59:26,051 --> 00:59:27,488
Come on.

1029
00:59:40,165 --> 00:59:43,067
Anyway, I'm Alex.

1030
00:59:43,069 --> 00:59:45,137
Spencer Gilpin.

1031
00:59:45,139 --> 00:59:48,238
Martha, Fridge and Bethany.

1032
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,608
Bethany? You're a girl?

1033
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:53,176
Woman.

1034
00:59:53,178 --> 00:59:55,415
In real life, you'd probably
wanna hit that.

1035
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:04,960
They got away.
Looks like they had help.

1036
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:07,725
Seaplane.

1037
01:00:07,727 --> 01:00:09,998
He must've crawled out
of his hole.

1038
01:00:11,165 --> 01:00:13,498
I'm sorry, boss.

1039
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,436
It won't happen again.

1040
01:00:18,405 --> 01:00:20,638
I know it won't.

1041
01:00:34,754 --> 01:00:36,288
What are you making?

1042
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,456
Margaritas. It's actually
one of my strengths.

1043
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:41,191
That and piloting,
although I did get shot down

1044
01:00:41,193 --> 01:00:43,429
by a couple orangutans
in fighter jets,

1045
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,566
so maybe not that great at it.

1046
01:00:46,665 --> 01:00:48,599
Anyway, cheers.

1047
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:50,369
Ah.

1048
01:00:50,371 --> 01:00:53,105
- Oh. Thanks.
- Sure.

1049
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,605
I've never had alcohol before.

1050
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,675
- Me either.
- Know what?

1051
01:00:56,677 --> 01:00:59,047
- What the hell? Woo!
- Lehayim.

1052
01:01:05,152 --> 01:01:08,287
- And I'm done with that.
- It's good.

1053
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,721
Can I get one more of those?

1054
01:01:09,723 --> 01:01:11,090
- Yeah.
- Alex?

1055
01:01:11,092 --> 01:01:12,491
What's up with
all these candles?

1056
01:01:12,493 --> 01:01:14,393
ALEX? Citronella. One
of my weaknesses

1057
01:01:14,395 --> 01:01:17,228
is mosquitoes,
which is kind of a bummer

1058
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:19,664
when you live alone
in an open hut in the jungle.

1059
01:01:20,835 --> 01:01:22,270
He's single.

1060
01:01:23,203 --> 01:01:24,537
Who's this?

1061
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:27,139
Who's Alan Parrish?

1062
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,574
He's the guy
who built this place.

1063
01:01:28,576 --> 01:01:31,543
Wait, other people have
been stuck here too?

1064
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:34,446
Yeah. This is Alan Parrish's
house. I'm just living in it.

1065
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:36,582
So, Alex, tell me,

1066
01:01:36,584 --> 01:01:39,250
how long have
you been in the game?

1067
01:01:39,252 --> 01:01:40,752
Oh, it's tough to say.

1068
01:01:40,754 --> 01:01:42,856
Time is kind of funny here.

1069
01:01:42,858 --> 01:01:44,323
But a few months, at least.

1070
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,724
- A few months?
- What?

1071
01:01:45,726 --> 01:01:47,227
Yeah, I can't seem to make it

1072
01:01:47,229 --> 01:01:48,727
past the transportation shed.

1073
01:01:48,729 --> 01:01:50,696
Transportation shed?
What's that?

1074
01:01:50,698 --> 01:01:52,431
It's the next level.

1075
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:55,200
First time, my hot-air balloon
wouldn't even take off.

1076
01:01:55,202 --> 01:01:58,106
And then there was the whole
plane thing I mentioned.

1077
01:01:59,207 --> 01:02:02,841
And once I got down
to my last life,

1078
01:02:02,843 --> 01:02:04,711
I realized I was screwed.

1079
01:02:04,713 --> 01:02:07,545
And that I was never gonna
get out of here by myself.

1080
01:02:07,547 --> 01:02:10,517
Half the stuff that came at me,
I had zero way to deal with.

1081
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,685
You can't kill a black mamba
with a margarita.

1082
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,589
You sure can't.
You need a zoologist for that.

1083
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,792
Alex, we can help each other.

1084
01:02:20,794 --> 01:02:23,396
You've been here a long time,
you know the game,

1085
01:02:23,398 --> 01:02:25,497
and between us,
we have a lot of strengths.

1086
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:28,503
Yeah. We're actually
pretty good together.

1087
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,236
I don't know, bro.

1088
01:02:31,238 --> 01:02:34,540
Okay, I mess up
one more time, I'm toast.

1089
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,575
Totally freaks me out
even thinking about

1090
01:02:36,577 --> 01:02:38,613
going back to
the transportation shed.

1091
01:02:40,582 --> 01:02:42,414
I don't wanna die in Jumanji.

1092
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:44,316
We just gotta stick together.

1093
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:46,421
If we do that, we can win.
I know we can.

1094
01:02:49,256 --> 01:02:51,691
Oh, my God.
You're our missing piece.

1095
01:02:51,693 --> 01:02:53,760
You were the thing
we needed to find.

1096
01:02:53,762 --> 01:02:56,261
So the clue was to, what,

1097
01:02:56,263 --> 01:02:58,698
go to the bazaar
to find the missing piece?

1098
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,535
It wasn't the elephant.

1099
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,672
- It was me.
- Yeah.

1100
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:10,377
Dudes, let's do this.

1101
01:03:10,379 --> 01:03:11,678
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1102
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,214
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

1103
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:16,348
Hey, Spencer,
you gonna drink that margarita?

1104
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,550
I... You're done.

1105
01:03:17,552 --> 01:03:19,818
This is one good margarita.

1106
01:03:27,696 --> 01:03:30,662
There it is. The
transportation shed.

1107
01:03:30,664 --> 01:03:32,765
There's all sorts
of vehicles inside.

1108
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,968
We gotta get one,
get across the canyon,

1109
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,705
and get to the Jaguar statue.

1110
01:03:37,707 --> 01:03:39,739
Okay, I see
the transportation shed,

1111
01:03:39,741 --> 01:03:42,408
I see the canyon, but
I still can't see the statue,

1112
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,544
which is weird 'cause
it's the most important thing

1113
01:03:44,546 --> 01:03:45,778
in Jumanji and it's huge.

1114
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,248
That's what she said.

1115
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:51,383
You drunk, Fridge?

1116
01:03:51,385 --> 01:03:53,452
What are you talking about?
I ain't drunk.

1117
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,388
- He is drunk.
- I had three little margaritas.

1118
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,991
You're about
half your usual size.

1119
01:03:57,993 --> 01:03:59,592
Whatever, whatever.

1120
01:03:59,594 --> 01:04:02,362
Alex, what do we do?
How do we get past these guards?

1121
01:04:02,364 --> 01:04:03,998
Last time,
I waited till they left.

1122
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,330
How long did that take?

1123
01:04:05,332 --> 01:04:07,868
- Three weeks?
- Oh, we gonna die.

1124
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,635
Okay. Plan B.

1125
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,538
Maybe there's
another door somewhere.

1126
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,375
But we gotta distract
those guys first.

1127
01:04:14,377 --> 01:04:15,743
I've got it.

1128
01:04:15,745 --> 01:04:18,310
Distracting guys is, like,
the main thing I do.

1129
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:19,880
He plays video games,
I distract guys.

1130
01:04:19,882 --> 01:04:22,649
Bethany, I hate to break it
to you right now,

1131
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:25,852
but you don't exactly
have the, um, the tool kit.

1132
01:04:25,854 --> 01:04:30,357
- Not me.
- What?

1133
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:33,027
- You have to go down there and flirt with those guys...
- No.

1134
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:35,496
- ...and hold their attention while we sneak in.
- No!

1135
01:04:35,498 --> 01:04:37,331
I can't just go over there
and flirt

1136
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,898
with some weird soldiers
I don't know.

1137
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,534
I know, but right now
we don't have a better idea.

1138
01:04:41,536 --> 01:04:44,774
You don't understand.
I actually can't do it.

1139
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:47,875
I can't talk to guys.

1140
01:04:47,877 --> 01:04:49,710
I'm terrible at it.

1141
01:04:49,712 --> 01:04:52,378
I can give you some pointers.

1142
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,949
No, I'm sorry. We
have to come up with another plan.

1143
01:04:55,951 --> 01:04:59,786
I'm not... No. Heh.
Not doing that.

1144
01:04:59,788 --> 01:05:02,422
Martha, you just have to
distract them long enough

1145
01:05:02,424 --> 01:05:03,690
for us to get into the shed.

1146
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,592
I really don't think
I can, I'm not...

1147
01:05:05,594 --> 01:05:09,663
Like, I'm not actually
some badass girl.

1148
01:05:09,665 --> 01:05:13,402
What are you talking about?
You're a total badass.

1149
01:05:15,738 --> 01:05:18,308
You could do anything.

1150
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,814
That's beautiful, Spencer.

1151
01:05:25,816 --> 01:05:28,649
Why don't I set you up
with a nice candlelight dinner?

1152
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:31,652
Or do you guys wanna get
the hell out of here?

1153
01:05:31,654 --> 01:05:33,053
All right.

1154
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:35,054
Show me how it's done.

1155
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,090
Class is in session.

1156
01:05:37,092 --> 01:05:38,559
- Come on, girl.
- Okay.

1157
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:40,527
Watch and learn.

1158
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:43,030
Hey, what did you mean by
that candlelight-dinner thing?

1159
01:05:43,032 --> 01:05:45,833
- What are you talking about?
- You said it, me and Martha,

1160
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:48,135
candlelight dinner.
What does that even mean?

1161
01:05:48,137 --> 01:05:50,504
The girl is into you, Spencer.

1162
01:05:50,506 --> 01:05:51,805
What?

1163
01:06:00,982 --> 01:06:02,915
Okay, in flirting situations,

1164
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,651
the key is making them
check you out

1165
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:05,986
without letting them know

1166
01:06:05,988 --> 01:06:07,921
that you know that
they're checking you out.

1167
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:10,457
You're like, "Whatever."
When they try to talk to you,

1168
01:06:10,459 --> 01:06:11,992
you can play it
one of three ways:

1169
01:06:11,994 --> 01:06:14,562
dumb, super into it, or nasty.

1170
01:06:14,564 --> 01:06:17,030
Which way you play it depends on
what guy you deal with.

1171
01:06:17,032 --> 01:06:19,867
This is like my dream and my
nightmare all at one time.

1172
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:21,836
I'm not gonna
take that personally.

1173
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:23,670
Now, hair is everything.

1174
01:06:23,672 --> 01:06:26,740
Touch it. Move it.
Play with it.

1175
01:06:26,742 --> 01:06:29,811
Move it around a lot.
Hypnotize them with it.

1176
01:06:29,813 --> 01:06:33,548
Give me a flip like that.
Okay, now angle your eyes down.

1177
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:34,849
Now, head down.

1178
01:06:34,851 --> 01:06:36,554
Tilt up. Eyes big.

1179
01:06:37,186 --> 01:06:38,787
- Now sparkle.
- Sparkle?

1180
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:41,056
Like an anime character.
Now sparkle.

1181
01:06:46,963 --> 01:06:48,896
Needs work.

1182
01:06:56,139 --> 01:06:57,738
Do you really think
she likes me?

1183
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:59,574
Why are we still
talking about this?

1184
01:06:59,576 --> 01:07:01,508
I mean, what if
she tries to kiss me?

1185
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:02,977
Then you just
kiss her back, man.

1186
01:07:02,979 --> 01:07:05,613
What if she tries
to kiss me, like...

1187
01:07:05,615 --> 01:07:07,749
Like, without warning?

1188
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:10,818
What are you talking about?
Haven't you ever kissed anyone?

1189
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,787
Don't... You gonna tell
the whole jungle?

1190
01:07:12,789 --> 01:07:14,723
Guys, I found
a side door. Over here.

1191
01:07:14,725 --> 01:07:16,859
- Guess what I found.
- No, no, don't tell him.

1192
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:18,626
Okay, let's talk about
your walk.

1193
01:07:18,628 --> 01:07:19,995
Take your time.

1194
01:07:19,997 --> 01:07:23,165
Make a meal of it.
Like a gorgeous gazelle.

1195
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:26,502
Or a horse. High-step it.
One foot in front of the other.

1196
01:07:26,504 --> 01:07:28,470
And bring it.
Boom, boom...

1197
01:07:28,472 --> 01:07:29,804
That's not it.

1198
01:07:29,806 --> 01:07:31,105
Yikes.

1199
01:07:31,107 --> 01:07:33,675
Anything you can do to
draw attention to the lips.

1200
01:07:33,677 --> 01:07:34,943
A little nibble like this.

1201
01:07:34,945 --> 01:07:37,979
A nibble goes
a long way, girlfriend.

1202
01:07:37,981 --> 01:07:40,215
Good. That's better.

1203
01:07:40,217 --> 01:07:42,083
Now smile.
You look terrified.

1204
01:07:42,085 --> 01:07:43,617
Oh, God, you're so funny.

1205
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:45,687
- You're so funny.
- Oh, God, you're so funny.

1206
01:07:45,689 --> 01:07:47,689
Oh, my God, you're so funny.

1207
01:07:47,691 --> 01:07:50,259
- I think I'm getting it.
- You are getting it. Go, girl.

1208
01:07:50,261 --> 01:07:52,560
Now, keep your lips
slightly parted, like...

1209
01:07:52,562 --> 01:07:54,596
Yeah, not-not gross,
just relaxed.

1210
01:07:54,598 --> 01:07:56,497
Touch your tongue
to the roof of your mouth.

1211
01:07:56,499 --> 01:07:58,500
- Like this.
- Like this?

1212
01:07:58,502 --> 01:08:00,168
- Like this.
- Like this?

1213
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:02,804
Like this.

1214
01:08:02,806 --> 01:08:04,772
Like this.

1215
01:08:04,774 --> 01:08:06,609
Like this?

1216
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:07,976
I think you're ready.

1217
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:11,112
- Cool.
- Okay, flirt

1218
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:12,982
like our lives depend on it.

1219
01:08:12,984 --> 01:08:14,116
'Cause they do.

1220
01:08:14,118 --> 01:08:15,717
Okay, there's the door.

1221
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:17,853
We just need something
to cut through the fence.

1222
01:08:17,855 --> 01:08:20,723
Okay, Fridge, you got anything
like that in the backpack?

1223
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:23,591
Uh, yeah, I should. What...?

1224
01:08:23,593 --> 01:08:26,795
Here you go. I got some...
Some bolt cutters.

1225
01:08:26,797 --> 01:08:29,265
Does that seem like a good tool
for the situation?

1226
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:31,567
Perfect, actually.

1227
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,234
It's called backpack power,
baby.

1228
01:08:34,872 --> 01:08:36,604
You guys,

1229
01:08:36,606 --> 01:08:38,239
I think this is gonna work.

1230
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:40,141
I think so too.
She's pretty fly.

1231
01:08:40,143 --> 01:08:42,845
And those guys don't meet
a lot of new people.

1232
01:08:42,847 --> 01:08:43,946
"Fly"?

1233
01:08:43,948 --> 01:08:45,747
Well, not like
Cindy Crawford fly,

1234
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:48,016
but for Jumanji, she the bomb.

1235
01:08:48,018 --> 01:08:49,551
"The bomb"?

1236
01:08:49,553 --> 01:08:51,287
- Cindy Crawford?
- That's your go-to?

1237
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:52,787
I'm just saying, I'm sure

1238
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:54,859
they'd like to
get jiggy with her.

1239
01:08:59,797 --> 01:09:00,765
Alex.

1240
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:03,769
What year do you think it is?

1241
01:09:04,769 --> 01:09:07,037
- What do you mean?
- Oh, no.

1242
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:09,540
It's 1996.

1243
01:09:12,243 --> 01:09:14,743
You're Alex Vreeke, aren't you?

1244
01:09:14,745 --> 01:09:16,045
Yeah, that's right.

1245
01:09:16,047 --> 01:09:17,948
Wait a minute,
you mean Freak House?

1246
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:20,715
Wait, what are you...
What are you guys talking about?

1247
01:09:20,717 --> 01:09:21,819
How do you know me?

1248
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,955
Alex, I don't know how
to tell you this...

1249
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:27,891
You've been in this game
for 20 years.

1250
01:09:27,893 --> 01:09:30,894
That's probably not
how I would've done it.

1251
01:09:30,896 --> 01:09:32,261
What?

1252
01:09:32,263 --> 01:09:34,331
No. You guys are messing
with me, right?

1253
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,332
No, we're not.
Alex Vreeke.

1254
01:09:36,334 --> 01:09:38,734
Everybody in Brantford
knows about you.

1255
01:09:38,736 --> 01:09:41,637
You're the kid that disappeared.

1256
01:09:41,639 --> 01:09:43,206
Twenty years ago.

1257
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:45,175
Twenty years?

1258
01:09:45,177 --> 01:09:47,944
Twenty years, man.

1259
01:09:47,946 --> 01:09:50,680
I don't even know
how to say this, but

1260
01:09:50,682 --> 01:09:52,882
Cindy Crawford, dude,
she's like 50 years old.

1261
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:56,185
- But still fly.
- Eh.

1262
01:09:56,187 --> 01:09:58,689
Wait...

1263
01:10:03,629 --> 01:10:04,864
There she is.

1264
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:14,039
Hey.

1265
01:10:15,773 --> 01:10:18,108
We're gonna get you home.

1266
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:20,776
Yeah.

1267
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,966
The hell is
going on with her butt?

1268
01:10:42,968 --> 01:10:44,900
Bethany, what did
you tell her to do?

1269
01:10:44,902 --> 01:10:46,970
Did she twist her ankle,
maybe, or...?

1270
01:10:46,972 --> 01:10:49,208
She's never flirted before.
Give her a break.

1271
01:10:53,778 --> 01:10:56,113
Hello, little lady.

1272
01:10:56,115 --> 01:10:58,150
What are you doing
out here all alone?

1273
01:11:00,452 --> 01:11:02,185
Hey, you guys.

1274
01:11:02,187 --> 01:11:04,754
I seem to be lost.

1275
01:11:04,756 --> 01:11:07,289
Can you guys help me?

1276
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:12,061
Hello, little lady.

1277
01:11:12,063 --> 01:11:14,165
What are you doing
out here all alone?

1278
01:11:18,036 --> 01:11:20,137
You guys are so
interesting and funny.

1279
01:11:20,139 --> 01:11:21,438
What's she doing?

1280
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,473
What, she got a bug in her hair?

1281
01:11:23,475 --> 01:11:26,042
She's forgotten
all of our training.

1282
01:11:26,044 --> 01:11:27,648
Let's go.

1283
01:11:31,718 --> 01:11:34,918
Wait! I... I... I
have to tell you

1284
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,221
about this book
that I've been reading.

1285
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:39,154
About microbiology.

1286
01:11:39,156 --> 01:11:43,162
Which is one of
my favorite biologies.

1287
01:11:49,469 --> 01:11:51,134
Hello, little lady.

1288
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:54,405
What are you doing
out here all alone?

1289
01:11:59,377 --> 01:12:02,782
You are a badass.

1290
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:08,753
â™Ş Ooh, baby I love your way â™Ş

1291
01:12:08,755 --> 01:12:12,222
â™Ş Every day, yeah â™Ş

1292
01:12:12,224 --> 01:12:13,824
Hey.

1293
01:12:13,826 --> 01:12:15,392
You guys like to dance?

1294
01:12:15,394 --> 01:12:17,261
â™Ş ...every day â™Ş

1295
01:12:17,263 --> 01:12:23,366
â™Ş Shadows grow so long
Before my eyes â™Ş

1296
01:12:23,368 --> 01:12:24,534
â™Ş And they're moving â™Ş

1297
01:12:24,536 --> 01:12:27,404
Oh, yeah, there we go.

1298
01:12:27,406 --> 01:12:30,173
â™Ş Across the page â™Ş

1299
01:12:30,175 --> 01:12:35,178
â™Ş Suddenly the day
Turns into night â™Ş

1300
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,481
â™Ş Ooh â™Ş

1301
01:12:36,483 --> 01:12:42,352
â™Ş Far away from the city â™Ş

1302
01:12:42,354 --> 01:12:44,789
Which one, which one, which one?

1303
01:12:46,893 --> 01:12:48,859
I hate this place.

1304
01:12:48,861 --> 01:12:52,964
â™Ş 'Cause your love
Just won't... â™Ş

1305
01:12:52,966 --> 01:12:55,466
Her strength is dance fighting.

1306
01:12:55,468 --> 01:12:58,269
Alex, what do you think, huh?
What's the move?

1307
01:12:58,271 --> 01:12:59,936
- What?
- What do we take?

1308
01:12:59,938 --> 01:13:01,838
- Which one?
- I don't know, man, okay?

1309
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,274
- I told you, I...
- We gotta fly.

1310
01:13:03,276 --> 01:13:05,075
The helicopter? We gotta fly.

1311
01:13:05,077 --> 01:13:06,346
I told you I don't know.

1312
01:13:08,413 --> 01:13:09,814
â™Ş ...light the skies â™Ş

1313
01:13:11,451 --> 01:13:17,288
â™Ş With the help
Of some fireflies â™Ş

1314
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:19,156
She's kicking their ass.

1315
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:20,423
That's our girl.

1316
01:13:20,425 --> 01:13:22,525
Yes, queen!

1317
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:24,396
â™Ş ...the power to shine â™Ş

1318
01:13:24,398 --> 01:13:30,333
â™Ş I can see them
Under the pine â™Ş

1319
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:32,369
She is destroying them.

1320
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:35,540
â™Ş But don't hesitate â™Ş

1321
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:37,174
â™Ş La di dah â™Ş

1322
01:13:37,176 --> 01:13:39,611
â™Ş 'Cause your love â™Ş

1323
01:13:39,613 --> 01:13:41,580
â™Ş Just won't wait â™Ş

1324
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:46,317
â™Ş Just won't wait â™Ş

1325
01:13:48,055 --> 01:13:51,989
â™Ş Ooh, baby I love your way â™Ş

1326
01:13:51,991 --> 01:13:54,992
â™Ş Every day â™Ş

1327
01:13:54,994 --> 01:13:57,361
â™Ş Wanna tell you
I love your way â™Ş

1328
01:13:57,363 --> 01:14:01,299
â™Ş I wanna tell you
I love your way â™Ş

1329
01:14:01,301 --> 01:14:04,068
â™Ş Wanna be with you
Night and day â™Ş

1330
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:08,906
â™Ş Every day and every way â™Ş

1331
01:14:08,908 --> 01:14:11,375
- You go, girl!
- Yeah.

1332
01:14:11,377 --> 01:14:13,210
Woo! Woo-hoo!

1333
01:14:13,212 --> 01:14:15,614
Go, go!

1334
01:14:15,616 --> 01:14:19,550
Yes! Yes! You're my hero.

1335
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,954
- We gotta go.
- You should give me

1336
01:14:22,956 --> 01:14:24,289
lessons in kicking ass.

1337
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:25,322
Give me a hug.

1338
01:14:25,324 --> 01:14:26,491
- Oh, my God.
- You did it.

1339
01:14:26,493 --> 01:14:28,326
- I did.
- Yeah, give me a hug, girlfriend.

1340
01:14:28,328 --> 01:14:31,130
As great of a moment as that is,
we ain't got the time.

1341
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:32,597
- Yeah.
- They coming.

1342
01:14:32,599 --> 01:14:34,233
The motorcycle freaks is coming.

1343
01:14:34,235 --> 01:14:36,402
Seaplane!
We got to fly, man.

1344
01:14:36,404 --> 01:14:39,004
Nope. I can't do it.

1345
01:14:39,006 --> 01:14:41,373
Okay? I told you,
I'm not a good pilot.

1346
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:44,042
Maybe we should take
the school bus.

1347
01:14:44,044 --> 01:14:46,411
We can't outrun no motorcycle
on no damn bus!

1348
01:14:46,413 --> 01:14:48,447
You picked the plane
and hot-air balloon.

1349
01:14:48,449 --> 01:14:49,682
Maybe pick the helicopter.

1350
01:14:49,684 --> 01:14:52,384
No, I can't do it. Okay?
I don't wanna die.

1351
01:14:52,386 --> 01:14:55,519
I'm freaking out a little bit.

1352
01:14:55,521 --> 01:14:58,656
Fine. I'll do it.

1353
01:14:58,658 --> 01:15:00,660
How hard can it be?
It's a helicopter.

1354
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,560
You... You press
a button, the...

1355
01:15:02,562 --> 01:15:04,228
They gonna spin. Okay.

1356
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:06,666
Then after that, I got my...
The... The lever.

1357
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,465
That's how...
That's how you getting

1358
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:09,935
the forward-backward action.

1359
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:12,571
Once we in the air,
I'mma be all right.

1360
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:14,439
This, I just gotta get...

1361
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:16,408
'Cause it ain't got
no step stool, so...

1362
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:18,678
Let me see something.
I can probably just...

1363
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,179
Get in, but be careful.

1364
01:15:20,181 --> 01:15:22,180
- No, you're drunk.
- No way. Nuh-uh.

1365
01:15:22,182 --> 01:15:24,450
Fridge, you're drunk.
Give me the keys.

1366
01:15:24,452 --> 01:15:27,052
- I'm?
- Alex. Alex.

1367
01:15:27,054 --> 01:15:28,386
If I can fight those guys,

1368
01:15:28,388 --> 01:15:31,189
you can fly this helicopter.
I know you can.

1369
01:15:31,191 --> 01:15:32,557
Come on.

1370
01:15:34,694 --> 01:15:37,228
Alex.

1371
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:39,598
This is where we need you.

1372
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,038
Remember,
you're the missing piece.

1373
01:15:45,471 --> 01:15:49,407
Seaplane McDonough
reporting for duty.

1374
01:15:49,409 --> 01:15:50,608
Let's go, people.

1375
01:16:11,598 --> 01:16:13,032
Whoa!

1376
01:16:13,034 --> 01:16:15,070
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1377
01:16:22,176 --> 01:16:24,578
- What's wrong?
- Something's broken!

1378
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,645
- What?
- What do you mean?

1379
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:28,613
Hang on!

1380
01:16:34,155 --> 01:16:36,221
Oh, my God, we're about to die!

1381
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,526
We're about to die!

1382
01:16:45,432 --> 01:16:47,800
- Oh, my God!
- It won't go up!

1383
01:16:47,802 --> 01:16:49,668
- What?
- What do you mean?

1384
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:51,069
The collective is busted.

1385
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,538
- What?
- It controls the plate up there,

1386
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:55,074
which tilts the rotors
and controls the pitch.

1387
01:16:55,076 --> 01:16:57,179
It's how we go up and down.

1388
01:17:04,385 --> 01:17:06,251
You guys?

1389
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:08,991
- That can't be good.
- It's no way that's good news.

1390
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:18,132
Albino rhinos!

1391
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,602
They're indigenous to Jumanji.

1392
01:17:23,604 --> 01:17:25,704
They're huge,
white, scary, and stupid,

1393
01:17:25,706 --> 01:17:27,477
- and they eat people.
- No.

1394
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:31,645
They're getting close!

1395
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,146
My stomach's starting
to bother me a bit.

1396
01:17:34,148 --> 01:17:36,382
- Go up!
- I can't go up!

1397
01:17:36,384 --> 01:17:38,251
I think I had
too many margaritas.

1398
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:45,091
You guys, what are we gonna do?

1399
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:46,426
I'll fix the helicopter.

1400
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,860
- Yes!
- Tell me what to do.

1401
01:17:47,862 --> 01:17:50,130
You gotta connect
the flight-control rod

1402
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,564
to the mesh plate
under the rotors.

1403
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:54,301
Flight-control rod, mesh plate,
under the rotors.

1404
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,270
- Wait, what?
- I'll be right back.

1405
01:17:56,272 --> 01:18:00,273
- Spencer, where are you going?
- Hurry up.

1406
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:01,808
- Be careful!
- No, no, just hurry up!

1407
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,478
All right, just
gonna stand on this thingy,

1408
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,418
pull myself up towards these
deadly helicopter blades. Okay.

1409
01:18:10,651 --> 01:18:12,719
There's the mesh plate.

1410
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:14,453
Here's that rod thingy.

1411
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,669
- Spencer!
- Speed it up, Alex!

1412
01:18:36,513 --> 01:18:38,147
Spencer!

1413
01:18:40,817 --> 01:18:44,088
Hurry! Come on, fix it!

1414
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:52,158
- Oh, my God!
- Running out of time!

1415
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,097
- Fix it, please!
- No, no, no.

1416
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:56,566
Got it!

1417
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:06,908
We made it! You did it!
I thought we were gonna die.

1418
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:08,208
- Oh.
- Yes!

1419
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,744
- Nice!
- Thank you.

1420
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:12,579
- Thank you, guys.
- You did it. That was scary.

1421
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,913
Oops.

1422
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,518
What?

1423
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,350
I dropped the jewel.

1424
01:19:18,352 --> 01:19:19,787
What?

1425
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:20,855
You dropped the jewel?

1426
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:22,323
I leaned over,

1427
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:23,958
thought I had to puke,
and I didn't.

1428
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,392
It came out of my backpack.

1429
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:27,528
- We need the freaking jewel!
- I know.

1430
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:30,530
That's-that's-that's the crazy
part 'cause I know we need it.

1431
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,499
So we're in a pickle.
We're in a pickle.

1432
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,267
Turn around.
We gotta go get it.

1433
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,270
Yeah, let's loop around.
Look for it.

1434
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:37,437
Everybody open your eyes.

1435
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,343
Let's all look for it
as a group.

1436
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,251
There! I see it!

1437
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:57,525
What are they doing?

1438
01:19:57,527 --> 01:19:59,760
It's like they're
protecting it or something.

1439
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:03,263
- How are we gonna do this?
- I don't know.

1440
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,298
Well, you gotta go get it,
right, buddy?

1441
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:10,837
What do you need?
Your boomerang?

1442
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:12,607
Maybe some scissors?

1443
01:20:12,609 --> 01:20:14,842
A pipe wrench?
Some shoelaces?

1444
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:17,846
I'm your valet. Whatever
you need, I can get it for you.

1445
01:20:17,848 --> 01:20:20,513
Okay? You just say the word.

1446
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,316
- What?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

1447
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,317
Sorry for what?

1448
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,621
Ow!

1449
01:20:33,763 --> 01:20:35,266
No.

1450
01:20:48,045 --> 01:20:49,678
Turn us around.

1451
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,215
No!

1452
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:56,617
Heel! Heel! Stop!

1453
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,485
Oh, my God!

1454
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:00,887
- No!
- Alex, get ready to roll us

1455
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,356
- to the side.
- What?

1456
01:21:03,894 --> 01:21:06,698
SPENCER; When I tell you,
roll 90 degrees to the right.

1457
01:21:08,032 --> 01:21:09,030
Now!

1458
01:21:13,437 --> 01:21:16,405
You pushed me out
the helicopter, jackass!

1459
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:20,909
Oh, wow!

1460
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:23,644
- Spencer, you're amazing.
- Thank you.

1461
01:21:23,646 --> 01:21:25,547
You are a killer pilot, Alex.

1462
01:21:25,549 --> 01:21:27,516
- Thanks.
- You too, Spencer,

1463
01:21:27,518 --> 01:21:29,517
- you were incredible!
- Thank you...

1464
01:21:29,519 --> 01:21:31,652
- Hey!
- ...but he was amazing, our pilot.

1465
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:33,387
- Excuse me.
- You killed it.

1466
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:34,556
Excuse me.

1467
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:35,723
Excuse me!

1468
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,793
I'm the one that
was a human sacrifice.

1469
01:21:37,795 --> 01:21:41,530
You don't know what's on
the underside of those rhinos.

1470
01:21:41,532 --> 01:21:43,464
And you don't wanna know.

1471
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:45,800
I've seen a lot of things.

1472
01:21:45,802 --> 01:21:47,768
Felt them on my face too.

1473
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,706
Things that I will never be able
to erase from memory.

1474
01:21:52,076 --> 01:21:53,541
Oh, that's funny to you guys.

1475
01:21:53,543 --> 01:21:55,880
Go ahead, laugh it up.
Get it out.

1476
01:21:58,515 --> 01:22:00,482
Guys, I've been trying
to get across

1477
01:22:00,484 --> 01:22:02,416
this canyon for, like,
20 years, okay?

1478
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,018
Do you realize how huge this is?

1479
01:22:08,826 --> 01:22:10,057
Mosquito.

1480
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:12,727
No, no, no!
Alex, no, no, no!

1481
01:22:12,729 --> 01:22:14,929
- Alex.
- Alex, no, no.

1482
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:16,365
Alex?

1483
01:22:16,367 --> 01:22:18,633
Alex, talk to me.
Wake up. Here we go.

1484
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:20,435
Alex? He's dying.

1485
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:22,438
No, we can't let him die.
We're too close!

1486
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,938
Does anyone know how to do CPR?

1487
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:27,075
Yeah, start with three chest
compressions and mouth-to-mouth.

1488
01:22:27,077 --> 01:22:29,010
One, two, three.

1489
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:30,713
How do I do this?

1490
01:22:30,715 --> 01:22:32,547
Okay, pinch his nose,
open his mouth,

1491
01:22:32,549 --> 01:22:33,815
- full lip-lock.
- Okay.

1492
01:22:33,817 --> 01:22:37,456
Ah, one breath, two breaths,
then repeat.

1493
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:47,465
Come on, Alex.

1494
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,604
Bethany, stop. Your tattoo.

1495
01:22:53,872 --> 01:22:56,675
It looks like you're giving him
one of your lives.

1496
01:22:58,443 --> 01:22:59,775
I'm okay with that.

1497
01:22:59,777 --> 01:23:01,544
What if you need it
for yourself?

1498
01:23:01,546 --> 01:23:03,749
I want Alex to come home too.

1499
01:23:17,996 --> 01:23:20,028
Oh!

1500
01:23:26,938 --> 01:23:28,670
- What happened?
- Alex,

1501
01:23:28,672 --> 01:23:31,107
Bethany gave you
one of her lives.

1502
01:23:31,109 --> 01:23:32,474
Bethany, you okay?

1503
01:23:32,476 --> 01:23:33,675
I think so.

1504
01:23:33,677 --> 01:23:35,143
Bethany, is that true?

1505
01:23:35,145 --> 01:23:37,479
You gave me one of your lives?

1506
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:39,482
I mean, yeah, of course.

1507
01:23:39,484 --> 01:23:41,787
Thank you.

1508
01:23:50,828 --> 01:23:52,495
What? What are
you looking at?

1509
01:23:52,497 --> 01:23:53,798
You got a situation.

1510
01:23:56,967 --> 01:23:59,869
Oh, my God,
these things are crazy.

1511
01:24:14,652 --> 01:24:16,722
Twenty years, huh?

1512
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:19,793
Yeah, I guess so.

1513
01:24:23,761 --> 01:24:24,960
You know,

1514
01:24:24,962 --> 01:24:27,898
I just keep thinking about
my poor parents.

1515
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,867
And what they must've
been through.

1516
01:24:29,869 --> 01:24:32,870
And why, because I was sitting
in my hideout,

1517
01:24:32,872 --> 01:24:34,706
too afraid to finish the game?

1518
01:24:38,576 --> 01:24:40,076
I'm sorry.

1519
01:24:40,078 --> 01:24:43,246
I don't mean to lay this on you.
I'm just...

1520
01:24:43,248 --> 01:24:45,181
You're really easy to talk to.

1521
01:24:45,183 --> 01:24:48,018
No, I get it.
I mean, sometimes

1522
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:51,019
it's easy to get so focused
on your own stuff

1523
01:24:51,021 --> 01:24:54,694
that you forget other people
have problems too.

1524
01:24:55,727 --> 01:24:57,126
That's really deep.

1525
01:24:57,128 --> 01:25:00,596
Thanks. I feel like
ever since I lost my phone,

1526
01:25:00,598 --> 01:25:02,701
my other senses have
kind of heightened.

1527
01:25:04,068 --> 01:25:07,606
Does "phone" mean something
different in the future?

1528
01:25:11,877 --> 01:25:13,911
What about you, Alex?
What are you like?

1529
01:25:13,913 --> 01:25:16,850
In the real world.
What's your vibe?

1530
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:19,649
Full-on metalhead.

1531
01:25:19,651 --> 01:25:22,622
A drummer, like my dad.

1532
01:25:37,235 --> 01:25:38,771
Hey.

1533
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:42,305
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

1534
01:25:42,307 --> 01:25:44,741
I, uh, I was just
filling these up.

1535
01:25:44,743 --> 01:25:46,946
- Cool.
- Yeah.

1536
01:25:50,915 --> 01:25:52,852
I'm glad you're here.
I, uh, ahem...

1537
01:25:54,686 --> 01:25:57,355
- I have something to tell you.
- Yeah?

1538
01:25:57,357 --> 01:25:58,988
And I wanna tell you now,

1539
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:00,324
just in case the next time

1540
01:26:00,326 --> 01:26:04,697
that we talk
I'm no longer brave.

1541
01:26:07,032 --> 01:26:08,634
I like you, Martha.

1542
01:26:09,701 --> 01:26:12,270
I, like, like you.

1543
01:26:13,673 --> 01:26:16,372
Like, I'm fully into you.

1544
01:26:16,374 --> 01:26:19,208
- You are?
- I am.

1545
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:20,979
And I have been

1546
01:26:20,981 --> 01:26:23,549
since, like, the seventh grade.

1547
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:25,817
Really?

1548
01:26:27,218 --> 01:26:30,187
Wowza. I don't think
this has ever happened before.

1549
01:26:30,189 --> 01:26:32,957
- What do you mean?
- Oh, I mean, like, I don't think

1550
01:26:32,959 --> 01:26:36,893
anyone's ever liked me that I...
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1551
01:26:36,895 --> 01:26:38,998
I never tell anyone how I fe...

1552
01:26:41,934 --> 01:26:44,571
I'm into you too, Spencer.

1553
01:26:45,671 --> 01:26:47,904
- You are?
- Yes. Yes! Heh, heh!

1554
01:26:47,906 --> 01:26:51,842
God, you're smart
and sweet and cute.

1555
01:26:51,844 --> 01:26:53,977
Yeah, I'm pretty into you.

1556
01:26:56,116 --> 01:27:01,751
Wait. Are you sure it's not
because of, like, all of...?

1557
01:27:01,753 --> 01:27:03,820
What? Oh, my God, no, no.

1558
01:27:03,822 --> 01:27:06,391
That is not my type.
I'm into nerds.

1559
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:08,760
Really?

1560
01:27:08,762 --> 01:27:10,227
I'm a nerd.

1561
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:32,783
- That was... I was so awful.
- I've never kissed anyone.

1562
01:27:32,785 --> 01:27:35,019
- You've never...?
- Never. That was the first time.

1563
01:27:35,021 --> 01:27:36,454
- I have never.
- Oh, you haven't?

1564
01:27:36,456 --> 01:27:37,822
- No.
- Okay. Cool.

1565
01:27:37,824 --> 01:27:40,193
You can't tell, right?

1566
01:27:43,163 --> 01:27:45,029
Come on. Hey!

1567
01:27:45,031 --> 01:27:47,864
I don't wanna see that.
I don't, not today.

1568
01:27:47,866 --> 01:27:49,934
While you're down here
professing your love

1569
01:27:49,936 --> 01:27:52,771
for one another,
I found the Jaguar.

1570
01:27:52,773 --> 01:27:56,373
Let's go. God! Ugh!

1571
01:28:06,285 --> 01:28:08,920
- There it is.
- There it is.

1572
01:28:08,922 --> 01:28:11,026
We'd better get walking.

1573
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,884
I think we just
follow this path.

1574
01:28:36,983 --> 01:28:39,254
No. It can't be that easy.

1575
01:28:40,453 --> 01:28:43,190
"The Defenders."

1576
01:28:44,492 --> 01:28:46,061
What does that mean?

1577
01:28:47,127 --> 01:28:49,063
There's only one way
to find out.

1578
01:28:51,232 --> 01:28:53,164
Fridge,

1579
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:54,432
give me the jewel.

1580
01:28:58,005 --> 01:28:59,274
Spencer.

1581
01:29:14,988 --> 01:29:16,888
Something's about to happen.

1582
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,923
I hate those drums.

1583
01:29:18,925 --> 01:29:22,026
What, you're just gonna
walk in there?

1584
01:29:22,028 --> 01:29:23,396
No.

1585
01:29:23,398 --> 01:29:27,335
That's what the game wants us
to do. Follow the path.

1586
01:29:28,536 --> 01:29:30,739
It's a trap.

1587
01:29:36,143 --> 01:29:38,145
"When you see the elephant...

1588
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:41,751
begin the climb."

1589
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:48,454
I'll go through the trees.

1590
01:29:48,456 --> 01:29:49,887
- The trees?
- Yeah.

1591
01:29:49,889 --> 01:29:51,390
Do you think
that's what that means?

1592
01:29:51,392 --> 01:29:52,490
That must be it.

1593
01:29:52,492 --> 01:29:54,293
That's the move.

1594
01:29:54,295 --> 01:29:57,162
This is the final level
of the game.

1595
01:29:57,164 --> 01:30:00,269
And I'm pretty sure
this is a Bravestone thing.

1596
01:30:05,104 --> 01:30:07,539
Did he just refer to himself
in the third person?

1597
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:11,012
Um, fourth person, I think.

1598
01:30:17,452 --> 01:30:19,484
How does he do that?

1599
01:30:19,486 --> 01:30:21,920
Climbing is one
of his strengths.

1600
01:30:21,922 --> 01:30:24,089
Oh. Gotcha.

1601
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:26,928
Cake makes me explode.

1602
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:51,217
- No! Spencer!
- Oh, my God!

1603
01:30:51,219 --> 01:30:53,486
Spencer!

1604
01:30:53,488 --> 01:30:56,455
Spencer!

1605
01:31:00,929 --> 01:31:02,495
Oh, my God, you guys.
Panthers.

1606
01:31:02,497 --> 01:31:04,099
No.

1607
01:31:08,336 --> 01:31:10,873
Those are jaguars.

1608
01:31:31,393 --> 01:31:33,160
Spencer!

1609
01:31:33,162 --> 01:31:34,994
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1610
01:31:34,996 --> 01:31:37,129
Yeah. I think so.

1611
01:31:37,131 --> 01:31:40,032
You still have the jewel, right?

1612
01:31:40,034 --> 01:31:41,534
- I got it.
- Oh, thank God.

1613
01:31:41,536 --> 01:31:42,669
Hey, what happened?

1614
01:31:42,671 --> 01:31:45,171
I don't wanna talk about it.

1615
01:31:45,173 --> 01:31:46,973
Okay, we need a new plan.

1616
01:31:46,975 --> 01:31:48,207
- Yeah.
- Right.

1617
01:31:48,209 --> 01:31:50,446
- Totally.
- Spencer, any ideas?

1618
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:55,051
Can I speak with you
for a minute?

1619
01:31:56,283 --> 01:31:57,452
Now?

1620
01:31:59,688 --> 01:32:01,891
What's going on?

1621
01:32:02,624 --> 01:32:04,156
I can't do this.

1622
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:07,460
- What are you talking about?
- I can't do this.

1623
01:32:07,462 --> 01:32:10,629
Okay, who am I kidding?
I'm not some adventurer.

1624
01:32:10,631 --> 01:32:13,166
I'm not actually brave.

1625
01:32:13,168 --> 01:32:15,568
Spencer, I just saw you
hanging out of a helicopter.

1626
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:19,038
It's a lot easier to be brave
when you have lives to spare.

1627
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,376
It's a lot harder...

1628
01:32:21,509 --> 01:32:23,710
when you only have one life.

1629
01:32:25,114 --> 01:32:28,614
We-we always only have
one life, man.

1630
01:32:28,616 --> 01:32:32,553
Okay? That's... That's all
we get. That's how it works.

1631
01:32:32,555 --> 01:32:36,255
The question is,
is how are you gonna live it?

1632
01:32:36,257 --> 01:32:39,162
Which guy are
you gonna decide to be?

1633
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:42,729
Did I just quote our principal?

1634
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:46,332
What the hell is this game doing
to me? I gotta get out of here.

1635
01:32:46,334 --> 01:32:47,600
Look.

1636
01:32:47,602 --> 01:32:50,006
We can do this, man.

1637
01:32:50,772 --> 01:32:52,342
We can do it together.

1638
01:32:56,012 --> 01:32:59,215
- Together.
- Together.

1639
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:03,219
You're a good friend, Fridge.

1640
01:33:06,588 --> 01:33:08,191
All right.

1641
01:33:09,226 --> 01:33:11,493
Okay. I don't know
video games,

1642
01:33:11,495 --> 01:33:13,760
but what I do know is football.

1643
01:33:13,762 --> 01:33:16,697
Now, those lightning-fast,
man-eating cats out there?

1644
01:33:16,699 --> 01:33:18,232
They're the Defenders.

1645
01:33:18,234 --> 01:33:20,634
Which means we gotta run
one hell of an offense.

1646
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:21,769
You guys.

1647
01:33:24,606 --> 01:33:26,105
We gotta go.

1648
01:33:26,107 --> 01:33:28,144
All right.
Here's what we're gonna do.

1649
01:33:30,678 --> 01:33:33,314
We're gonna fan out
and run a play that I call:

1650
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:35,581
"The Double Reverse
Refrigerator."

1651
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:38,586
Bethany,
you go up the left side.

1652
01:33:38,588 --> 01:33:40,254
I'll go up the right.

1653
01:33:40,256 --> 01:33:42,156
Alex, you'll draw the defense,

1654
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:43,624
so Spencer can go up the middle.

1655
01:33:43,626 --> 01:33:45,526
- I'll go with Spencer.
- No.

1656
01:33:45,528 --> 01:33:47,528
There's something else
we need you to do.

1657
01:33:48,797 --> 01:33:52,399
â™Ş Ooh, baby I love your way â™Ş

1658
01:33:52,401 --> 01:33:55,402
â™Ş Every day, yeah â™Ş

1659
01:33:55,404 --> 01:33:58,839
â™Ş Ooh, baby I love your way â™Ş

1660
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:00,475
You guys like to dance?

1661
01:34:02,312 --> 01:34:07,417
â™Ş Shadows grow so long
Before my eyes â™Ş

1662
01:34:17,427 --> 01:34:19,594
Hey! Over here!

1663
01:34:19,596 --> 01:34:21,565
Come and get me!

1664
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:39,747
â™Ş I wanna tell you, I wanna
Tell you, I wanna tell you â™Ş

1665
01:34:45,856 --> 01:34:48,358
No! No.

1666
01:34:59,669 --> 01:35:01,205
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1667
01:35:03,707 --> 01:35:05,476
Get to the statue. Go!

1668
01:35:25,695 --> 01:35:27,197
Oh, no! I...

1669
01:36:02,865 --> 01:36:06,437
Ah, whoa, whoa.

1670
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:39,735
Oh, man. Okay.

1671
01:36:39,737 --> 01:36:41,803
Stay calm, don't panic.

1672
01:36:41,805 --> 01:36:43,441
Stop!

1673
01:36:47,978 --> 01:36:49,780
It's the elephant and the mouse.

1674
01:36:51,549 --> 01:36:52,948
What's up?

1675
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:54,917
Mouse Finbar.

1676
01:36:54,919 --> 01:36:57,019
Zoologist.

1677
01:36:57,021 --> 01:36:59,622
Zoologist and...

1678
01:36:59,624 --> 01:37:01,792
And backpack guy.

1679
01:37:21,013 --> 01:37:24,417
Give me the jewel,
or your friend dies.

1680
01:37:26,017 --> 01:37:28,316
- Don't give it to him!
- Quiet!

1681
01:37:28,318 --> 01:37:29,753
Stop!

1682
01:37:34,524 --> 01:37:37,496
Take me instead, okay?

1683
01:37:46,071 --> 01:37:47,639
Give me the jewel.

1684
01:37:48,706 --> 01:37:50,038
I can't do that.

1685
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,873
Five.

1686
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:55,343
- Four, three...
- I can't give you the jewel.

1687
01:37:55,345 --> 01:37:56,745
- Spencer.
- Two!

1688
01:37:56,747 --> 01:37:58,781
Because I don't have it!

1689
01:38:06,425 --> 01:38:08,326
Zoology, bitch!

1690
01:38:19,805 --> 01:38:21,737
No, no, no! Don't...

1691
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:31,181
Douche bag! You suck!

1692
01:38:35,052 --> 01:38:37,422
- Elephant.
- "Begin the climb."

1693
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:42,525
Leave her alone!

1694
01:38:42,527 --> 01:38:44,494
Get up there,
I'll get the jewel to you.

1695
01:38:44,496 --> 01:38:45,728
- Martha.
- Trust me.

1696
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:47,699
- I'll get it to you. Go.
- Okay.

1697
01:38:54,706 --> 01:38:56,542
Go, Martha!

1698
01:39:04,015 --> 01:39:05,382
Alex!

1699
01:40:05,511 --> 01:40:07,414
I'll take that.

1700
01:40:19,859 --> 01:40:22,192
Game over.

1701
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:33,707
I don't think so.

1702
01:40:38,578 --> 01:40:39,913
Venom's my weakness.

1703
01:41:09,842 --> 01:41:10,844
Go, Spencer.

1704
01:41:20,853 --> 01:41:21,923
No.

1705
01:41:33,866 --> 01:41:35,502
- Yeah! - Wow!
- Yeah.

1706
01:41:48,681 --> 01:41:50,148
"Call out its name."

1707
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:51,283
Call out its name!

1708
01:41:51,285 --> 01:41:53,017
Call out its name, everyone!

1709
01:41:53,019 --> 01:41:54,618
Jumanji!

1710
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:58,089
Jumanji!

1711
01:42:38,932 --> 01:42:40,998
- I think we did it.
- I think we won.

1712
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,901
I think we did.

1713
01:42:42,903 --> 01:42:45,070
Guys, it's Nigel.

1714
01:42:45,072 --> 01:42:46,705
Nigel.

1715
01:42:54,882 --> 01:42:57,216
Well done, intrepid adventurers!

1716
01:42:57,218 --> 01:42:58,716
You lifted the curse!

1717
01:42:58,718 --> 01:43:01,019
All of Jumanji thanks you.

1718
01:43:01,021 --> 01:43:02,320
Your work here is done.

1719
01:43:02,322 --> 01:43:05,290
So, sadly,
this is where we part.

1720
01:43:05,292 --> 01:43:07,158
Seaplane McDonough,

1721
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,864
let me shake your hand.

1722
01:43:16,069 --> 01:43:17,572
Alex.

1723
01:43:22,175 --> 01:43:24,611
Adieu, Professor Oberon.

1724
01:43:30,384 --> 01:43:31,986
Later, dude.

1725
01:43:37,991 --> 01:43:39,991
I'll miss you the most,
my little Mouse.

1726
01:43:39,993 --> 01:43:42,096
Get me the hell out of here.

1727
01:43:49,836 --> 01:43:51,871
Farewell, Ruby Roundhouse.

1728
01:43:53,141 --> 01:43:54,739
Wait.

1729
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:56,711
What if we didn't go back?

1730
01:43:58,211 --> 01:43:59,814
I just...

1731
01:44:00,915 --> 01:44:04,720
I like being like this.
With you.

1732
01:44:05,719 --> 01:44:08,988
Then let's be like this,

1733
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,858
every day.

1734
01:44:12,192 --> 01:44:14,662
Just come home.

1735
01:44:31,713 --> 01:44:33,181
Dr. Bravestone.

1736
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:48,930
Nigel, I'm ready to go home.

1737
01:44:49,863 --> 01:44:51,800
Farewell, my good man.

1738
01:44:56,737 --> 01:44:58,874
See you later, Bravestone.

1739
01:45:28,936 --> 01:45:30,136
Oh, my God.

1740
01:45:30,138 --> 01:45:33,439
Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes!
I'm back, baby!

1741
01:45:33,441 --> 01:45:36,176
I will never complain
about my body ever again.

1742
01:45:36,178 --> 01:45:37,476
Oh, thank God.

1743
01:45:37,478 --> 01:45:38,980
Oh, I missed you.

1744
01:45:45,086 --> 01:45:46,188
Where's Alex?

1745
01:46:08,544 --> 01:46:10,846
Wait, look.

1746
01:46:14,282 --> 01:46:15,852
Freak House?

1747
01:46:19,554 --> 01:46:21,222
Do you think...?

1748
01:46:21,224 --> 01:46:23,826
That means, maybe...

1749
01:46:33,969 --> 01:46:35,971
- Grandpa!
- Hey!

1750
01:46:37,372 --> 01:46:41,074
Come here. Come here.
Oh, that's my girl.

1751
01:46:41,076 --> 01:46:44,377
- Hi!
- So good to see you.

1752
01:46:44,379 --> 01:46:47,048
Come on. Come on
and say hi to Grandma.

1753
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:49,149
- Alex?
- Hey, Dad, when you get a sec,

1754
01:46:49,151 --> 01:46:51,585
- could you give us a hand?
- Yeah.

1755
01:46:51,587 --> 01:46:54,119
Oh, that is some tree.

1756
01:46:54,121 --> 01:46:57,093
- Yeah, it's not too bad.
- Yeah.

1757
01:47:01,564 --> 01:47:03,330
Hey, Dad, will you
give me a second?

1758
01:47:03,332 --> 01:47:05,935
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- I'll be right back.

1759
01:47:20,115 --> 01:47:21,217
Bethany?

1760
01:47:23,652 --> 01:47:26,823
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

1761
01:47:27,523 --> 01:47:28,589
Ruby Roundhouse?

1762
01:47:32,327 --> 01:47:34,131
And that would make you Fridge.

1763
01:47:38,635 --> 01:47:40,668
I'm stoked to see you.

1764
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:42,206
All of you.

1765
01:47:43,439 --> 01:47:45,973
- You made it back.
- Yeah, I did.

1766
01:47:45,975 --> 01:47:48,979
It spit me out
right where I started, so...

1767
01:47:50,279 --> 01:47:51,611
1996.

1768
01:47:51,613 --> 01:47:54,581
And your parents and your house?

1769
01:47:54,583 --> 01:47:57,421
Yeah, they... All good, bro.

1770
01:48:00,989 --> 01:48:03,257
You're an adult now.

1771
01:48:03,259 --> 01:48:04,692
You have a family.

1772
01:48:04,694 --> 01:48:06,626
I do, yeah.

1773
01:48:06,628 --> 01:48:08,629
This is Andy.

1774
01:48:08,631 --> 01:48:10,232
And then my daughter...

1775
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:13,471
My daughter's name is Bethany.

1776
01:48:16,005 --> 01:48:18,438
We named her after the girl
who saved my life.

1777
01:48:25,382 --> 01:48:27,485
So stoked. Heh.

1778
01:48:47,437 --> 01:48:48,702
Yo.

1779
01:48:48,704 --> 01:48:50,173
Yo.

1780
01:48:51,173 --> 01:48:54,742
You wanna go backpacking?

1781
01:48:54,744 --> 01:48:57,144
Like, in nature?

1782
01:48:57,146 --> 01:49:00,014
Yeah, but, like, somewhere,
like, really amazing.

1783
01:49:00,016 --> 01:49:02,617
Next summer?
What do you think?

1784
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:05,155
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

1785
01:49:06,322 --> 01:49:08,254
Oh, um, I'll catch you later.

1786
01:49:08,256 --> 01:49:10,060
I'll see you after class?

1787
01:49:11,061 --> 01:49:13,161
- Hey!
- Hello.

1788
01:49:13,163 --> 01:49:15,263
- Hey.
- So, uh, anything...

1789
01:49:15,265 --> 01:49:16,997
interesting happen lately?

1790
01:49:16,999 --> 01:49:19,033
No, I can't think of anything.

1791
01:49:19,035 --> 01:49:20,367
Yeah. Heh.

1792
01:49:20,369 --> 01:49:22,069
Have you guys talked to Martha?

1793
01:49:22,071 --> 01:49:24,571
Oh, I was texting her
this weekend.

1794
01:49:24,573 --> 01:49:27,044
Have you talked to her?

1795
01:49:28,044 --> 01:49:30,046
Hey. There she is.

1796
01:49:35,084 --> 01:49:38,221
Go get that girl,
Dr. Bravestone.

1797
01:49:45,796 --> 01:49:47,162
Hi.

1798
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:49,331
- Hi.
- I really...

1799
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:51,233
- I really wanted to call you.
- I get it.

1800
01:49:51,235 --> 01:49:53,167
Sorry, I don't know
why I didn't call.

1801
01:49:53,169 --> 01:49:54,502
It's weird being out and,

1802
01:49:54,504 --> 01:49:57,505
not, like, knowing,
like, what's going on and...

1803
01:50:01,311 --> 01:50:02,645
What?

1804
01:50:16,092 --> 01:50:17,561
Smoldering.
